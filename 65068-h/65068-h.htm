<h2>PREFACE.</h2>

<hr class="r15" />

<p>In submitting the present edition of the following poem, entitled
<i>Terrible Tractoration</i>, to the American public, the author complies
not only with solicitations of personal friends, but with expressed
wishes of many gentlemen to whom he is personally a stranger. They say
that by stripping folly of some of its disguises, and plucking the mask
of deception from that impudent charlatanry, which encumbers the “march
of improvement,” this burlesque production may be of service to mankind.</p>

<p>The origin of the poem entitled Tractoration, is as follows: In the
year 1801 the author, (who is a native of Walpole, New Hampshire,)
was in London, on business as an agent for a Company in Vermont. In
that Metropolis he became acquainted with Mr Benjamin Douglas Perkins,
proprietor of a patent right for making and using certain implements,
called Metallic Tractors. These were said to cure diseases in all
or nearly all cases of topical inflammation, by conducting from the
diseased part the surplus of electric fluid which in such cases, causes
or accompanies the morbid affection. At the request of that gentleman,
the author undertook to make the Tractors the theme of a satirical
effusion in Hudibrastic verse. This was originally intended for the
corner of a newspaper, but subsequently in the first edition enlarged
to a pamphlet of about fifty pages royal octavo. It was published in
the summer of 1803, well received, and a second edition called for in
less than two months. A new and enlarged edition was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[iv]</a></span> put to press, and
met with a favorable reception both from the public and the reviewers.
From the success which attended Tractoration, the author was induced to
publish in London a small volume of <i>Original Poems</i>, which was well
received and favorably reviewed.</p>

<p>The author never would have written a syllable intended to give
Metallic Tractors favorable notoriety, had he not believed in their
efficacy. As conductors of what is called animal electricity, and in
principle allied to Galvanic stimulants, even their <i>modus operandi</i>,
he thought, might be in a great measure explained. Respectable English
Reviews and other periodicals gave favorable notices of the Tractors,
and Mr Perkins exhibited to the author testimonials in favor of those
implements from several professors of universities, many regular
physicians, surgeons, clergymen, and others, men of as high standing
and influence as any in community.</p>

<p>But although the author was willing to aid the proprietor of the
tractors, he did not confine himself to topics connected with those
implements. He made use of Tractoration as the title, and the tractors
as the apology for a poem, in which he essayed to paint</p>

  <div class="poetry-container">
    <div class="poetry">
      <div class="stanza">
        <div>&mdash;&mdash;“every idle thing</div>
        <div>Which Fancy finds in her excursive flight.”</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

<p>Although many of the subjects alluded to, or animadverted on were
intended to be satirized, others were introduced merely to give them
notoriety, or honorable mention in a humorous way; to <i>laugh with</i>
rather than to <i>laugh at</i> the inventors, and rather to <i>advertise</i> than
to <i>stigmatise</i> their inventions, &amp;c. Persons of this description will
perceive our objects, appreciate our motives, and recollect that Dr
Caustic, by virtue of a figure in rhetoric, called <i>irony</i>, can speak
one thing and mean another, without uttering falsehood.</p>

<p>The author conceives that he was fortunate as regards the plan of
<i>Tractoration</i>. <i>Dr Caustic</i>, who may be styled the <i>hero</i> of the
poem, is represented as a visionary, eccentric, would-be philosopher,
endeavoring to effect “grand discoveries and inventions” of most
“immense<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v" id="Page_v">[v]</a></span> utility,” but had received so little encouragement that he
was impelled by necessity to petition the Royal College of Physicians
in London, for relief from penury, and assistance in his projects. In
pursuance of this plan, every thing novel, singular, relating to any
human pursuit, it was competent for Dr Caustic to make the object of
discussion or animadversion.</p>

<p>The miscellaneous poems, which, in this little volume succeed
<i>Tractoration</i>, are, in part, selected from a volume first published
in London, and partly from poems written in this country since
the author’s return from Europe. He hopes not to be condemned for
unpardonable egotism, if he quotes a passage or two from English and
American reviews relative to his poetical productions. If a traveller
produces passports, or a candidate for office exhibits recommendations,
we do not condemn him for pride, nor chastise him for presumption.</p>

<p>The Gentleman’s Magazine, published in London, Jan. 1804, contains a
long notice of <i>Tractoration</i>, from which the following passages are
extracted:</p>

<blockquote class="font">

<p>“In the first Canto the author, in an inimitable strain of
irony, ridicules those pretended discoveries and inventions
of certain pseudo-philosophers both of the natural and moral
class, which have no tendency to meliorate the condition of
man.” After many extracts from the work, and encomiums on
each of the four cantos, the reviewers conclude, “Whatever
may be the merits of the Metallic Tractors, or the demerits
of their opponents, we have no hesitation to pronounce this
performance to be far superior to the ephemeral productions of
ordinary dealers in rhyme. The notes, which constitute more
than half the book, are not behind the verse in spirit. Who
the author can be we have not the least conception; but from
the intimate acquaintance he discovers with the different
branches of medical science, we should imagine him to be
some jolly son of Galen, who, not choosing to bestow all his
arts upon his <span class="smcap">PATIENTS</span>, has humanely applied a few
<span class="smcap">ESCHAROTICS</span> for the benefit of his brethren.”</p></blockquote>

<p>The following is extracted from a review written by the Hon. Daniel
Webster, while a student at law in Boston.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span></p>

<blockquote class="font">

<p>“In commending <span class="smcap">Christopher Caustic</span>, we are only
subscribing to the opinions expressed by the people of another
country. To be behind that country in our appreciation of his
merits, were a stigma; it is very pardonable to go beyond it.
National vanity may be a folly, but national ingratitude is
a crime. Terrible Tractoration was successful on its first
appearance in England, and as yet seems to have lost none of
its popularity. It belongs to that class of productions which
have the good fortune to escape what Johnson angrily, but too
justly, denominates the general conspiracy of human nature
against cotemporary merit.”</p>

<p class="r1"><i>Monthly Anthology for April, 1805.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>The eminence of Mr Webster, whose acquisitions as a scholar are
scarcely exceeded by his qualifications as a statesman, is our apology
for exhibiting the above testimony of his approbation.</p>

<p>We might add to the above, other extracts from about twenty English and
American Reviewers, in which the poems contained in this little volume
have been taken notice of with much commendation; but we hope the work
may meet a favorable reception without such extraneous assistance.</p>

<p>In the present edition of Tractoration several new subjects are
introduced and thrown into the crucible of Dr Caustic. Among these are
Phrenology, Abolition, Amalgamation, Temperance, Reformation, &amp;c. &amp;c.
These parts were written expressly for this edition of Tractoration,
were intended to “shoot folly as it flies,” and adapt the strictures of
satire to the topics of the times.</p>

Fitted for female education.</h3>

<p><a href="#Page_25">Page 25</a>. We are point blank opposed to allowing females any advantages
for education, which can possibly induce their ladyships to set up
for literata. “<i>Knowledge is Power</i>,” and whereas the “seraphic sex”
are prone to acquire knowledge with more facility, and communicate
it with more felicity than the rough samples of humanity with whom
Madam Destiny has had the impudence to connect them by ties (pretty
easily severed nowadays) we are amazingly apprehensive that ladies
will not only monopolize our trade of authorship, but usurp our
places in Church, State and Medicine. We have often shed cataracts of
tears (Della Crusca) over the following lines of Pope, which, though
addressed to lady Montague, will apply equally well to nine hundred
and ninety-nine other lady luminaries, in whose presence the light of
Dr <span class="smcap">Caustic</span> is like the glimmer of a glow worm in the glare of
sunshine.</p>

<p>We are excessively provoked with the conductors of the North American
Review, who in the No. of that work, dated October, 1835, p. 430, have
reviewed, or rather eulogized certain Poems by Mrs Sigourney, and by
Miss Gould. And what makes such conduct the more preposterous is that
those ladies <i>deserve</i> the encomiums of their admiring Reviewers.
They have, likewise, brought into bold relief a great number of
lady-authors, such as Miss Burney, Miss Edgworth, Miss Baillie, Miss
Martineau, Miss Mitford, Mrs Somerville, Mrs Hemans, Miss Sedgwick,
Miss Leslie, Mrs Child, Mrs Hale, &amp;c., whose names and whose merits,
correct policy would have consigned to oblivion. Now, be it known, by
these presents, that the more merit there happens to be attached to a
lady-author, the more her productions should <i>not</i> be taken honorable
notice of by a gentleman-critic.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_54">Page 54</a>. Some doctors, however, do not coincide in opinion with Dr
Caustic on this subject. Dr Miller, in a <i>“Report on the malignant
disease, which prevailed in New York, in the autumn of 1805,” has the
following passage</i>:</p>

<p>“We live in the latitude of pestilence, and our climate now perhaps
is only beginning to display its tendency to produce this terrible
scourge. The impurities which time and a police, rather moulded in
conformity to the usages of more northern countries than the exigencies
of our own, have been long accumulating, are now annually exposed
to the heats of a burning summer, and send forth exhalations of the
highest virulence.”</p>

<hr class="r25" />

<h3>No. III.</h3>

<p><a href="#Page_82">Page 82</a>, we told your worships, that Perkins was supported by Aldini,
and promised some additional remarks by way of illustrating our
assertion. We now intend to prove not only that we were correct in our
statement, but that light, heat or caloric, electricity, Galvanism,
Perkinism, animal spirits, the social feelings, especially when <i>love</i>
is concerned, and the stimulus of society, are all intimately connected
or different modifications of the same matter.</p>

<p>We will show that <i>light</i> and <i>heat</i> are the same thing in essence, by
the authority of some of our prime philosophers whom it would be heresy
to dispute or gainsay.</p>

<p>“Universal space,” says Dr Franklin, “so far as we know of it, seems
filled with a subtil fluid, whose motion, or vibration, is called light.</p>

<p>“This fluid may possibly be the same with that which attracted by
and entering into other more solid matter, dilates the substance, by
separating the constituent particles and so rendering some <i>solids
fluid</i>, and maintaining the fluidity of others; of which fluid when
our bodies are totally deprived, they are said to be frozen; when they
have a proper quantity they are in health, and fit to perform all their
functions; it is then called natural heat; when too much, it is called
fever; and when forced into the body in too great a quantity from
without, it gives pain by separating and destroying the flesh, and is
then called burning; and the fluid so entering and acting is called
fire.” <i>Transactions of the American Philosophical Society</i>, vol. iii.
p. 5, 6.</p>

<p>Now we will see what Lavoisier, according to Fourcroy, can tell us on
this subject.</p>

<p>“The comparison which the more modern philosophers, and particularly my
illustrious friend Monge, have established between <i>caloric and light</i>,
so as to consider these two effects as the <i>product of modifications of
the same body</i>, is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span> entitled to much more attention. It is established
on a great number of experiments; it naturally and simply explains most
of the phenomena; and it agrees with the sublime economy of nature,
which multiplies effects much more than the bodies which produce them.</p>

<p>“Fire,” he continues, “is disengaged, and shows itself in the form of
<i>heat</i>, when it is gently and slowly driven out of bodies into the
composition of which it entered; but it shines in the form of <i>light</i>
when it flies out of compounds, in a very compressed state, by a swift
motion.</p>

<p>“According to this ingenious hypothesis, <i>caloric</i> may become <i>light</i>,
and <i>light</i> on the other hand may become <i>caloric</i>. For this purpose
it is only necessary that the first should assume more rapidity in its
motion, and the second undergo a diminution of velocity.” <i>Nicholsons’
Fourcroy</i>, vol. i. p. 57.</p>

<p>Our next step in this our wonderful process is to prove, that light,
which is the same as heat, may also be identified with <i>electricity</i>.</p>

<p>Here I shall produce the authority of a writer in the Encyclopædia
Britannica, who appears to be a very sound philosopher. Under the title
Electricity, article 83, you will find that gunpowder has been fired by
the electric blast; from which the writer reasons as follows.</p>

<p>“As it therefore appears, that the electric fluid, when it moves
through bodies either with great rapidity or in very great quantity
will set them on fire, <i>it seems scarce disputable</i>, that this fluid
is the same with the <i>element of fire</i>. This being once admitted, the
source from whence the electric fluid is derived into the earth and
atmosphere must be exceedingly evident, being no other than the sun
or source of light itself.” The writer then proceeds to show, that an
iron wire has been melted by the discharge of a battery of electricity,
and furnishes proofs which must convince the most incredulous, of the
correctness of his theory.</p>

<p>Thus far we have proceeded triumphantly in making it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span> abundantly
evident that light, heat, and electricity are the same in substance;
so that if your worships will permeate this subject with due retention
and some small share of true philosophical perspicacity, you will find
that heat and electricity are the dregs or sediment of light, and by
digesting Dr Black’s theory of latent heat, you will find that the
matter of heat, light, and electricity exists in very vast abundance in
all bodies and substances.</p>

<p>We next will prove that Galvanism is a modification of electricity.
Here we will advert to the theory of Galvani and Aldini, as stated by
C. H. Wilkinson, lecturer on Galvanism in Soho square, Member of the
Royal College of Surgeons, &amp;c. &amp;c. This gentleman informs us, that “the
animal body is a description of <i>Leyden phial</i>, or magic battery, in
one part of which there is an excess of electricity, and in the other
a deficiency. <i>The conducting body communicates the fluid of the part
where it is abundant to the part</i> where it is defective; and in this
passage of the electricity, the muscular contractions are obtained in
the same way as the discharges are produced by the Leyden phial or
magic batteries. As the <i>conducting bodies</i> in electricity are the sole
agents in the discharge of the Leyden phial, so the same bodies alone
serve likewise to excite muscular contractions.” <i>Wilkinson’s Elements
of Galvanism</i>, p. 82.</p>

<p>We next will prove that Perkins’s points are the proper conductors of
animal electricity. From a specification which Mr Perkins published
in the Repertory of Arts, it would seem that <i>zinc</i> is the principal
ingredient in the tractors.</p>

<p>“Zinc,” says Fourcroy, “is a conductor of electricity like all other
metals, and nothing particular has hitherto been discovered in it with
respect to this property; however, the <i>powerful manner in which it
effects the sensibility of the human body in Galvanic experiments seems
to give it herein a sort of prerogative</i> or pre-eminence over other
metallic substances. If we place a plate of zinc under the tongue,
and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span> cover the upper surface of this organ with another metal, and
especially a piece of gold or silver, and then incline the extremity
of this last, so as to approach it to the plate of zinc, at the moment
when the two metals come into contact with each other, the person who
performs the experiments feels a very perceptible pricking sensation,
heat, irritation, and a sort of acerb taste in the tongue, almost
always accompanied with a <i>momentous</i> glare, or luminous circle, which
suddenly appears before his eyes. No metal produces this singular
effect with such force as zinc is observed to do.”</p>

<p>This animal electricity is likewise a modification of what we call
<i>animal spirits</i>, and may be termed the <i>stimulus of society</i>. That
this was well known to the wisest of men, is evident from this adage
of Solomon: “Iron sharpeneth iron; so a man sharpeneth the countenance
of his friend.” The want of a proper communication among animal
Leyden phials is the cause of the gloom of the <i>solitaire</i>. The wish
to partake of the benefits of the stimulus of society makes man a
gregarious animal, and induces the human race to congregate in large
cities, and to be fond of routs, balls, assemblies, in which the
aforesaid human electric phials are beaming <i>animal electricity</i> in
every direction, and thus a flow of animal spirits is communicated by a
pleasing contagion to all present.</p>

<p>When we see an animal Leyden phial superabounding with animal
electricity, we say it is a <i>spirited animal</i>. When said animal happens
to be a hero, a tiger, an irritated ram cat, or a black snake intent
on his game, visible flashes of electricity will blaze from the eyes,
and communicate very sensible shocks to a spectator. Thus the Gaul,
who was commanded to cut off the head of Marius, a celebrated Roman
general, and a personage full of the most <i>positive sort of animal
electricity</i>, received such a <i>stroke</i> of lightning from the battery
of that hero’s head, and at the same time was so <i>thunderstruck</i> with
the exclamation of “<i>Tune, homo,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span> audes occidere Caium Marium?</i>” that
the dagger dropped bloodless from the hands of the ruthless assassin.
Thus Alexander, when hampered in the chief city of the Oxydracæ,
kept his foes at a distance by the fire that flashed from his eyes
in whole torrents of animal electricity. How often do we see a
Congressional spouter, or an itinerant field preacher <i>electrize</i> a
large assembly by repeated discharges of this mysterious fluid. In all
cases of fanaticism it is mistaken for the fire of devotion, and causes
grimaces, contortions, convulsions, and other strange symptoms, which,
however, are easily accounted for by the theory of the “animal Leyden
phial.”</p>

<p>But the prettiest experiments ever made with animal electricity, I
have seen sometimes exhibited by a female philosopher to a levee
of her admirers. On such occasions, the lady’s eyes seem to be
fountains of <i>animal electricity</i>. This electricity, however, is not
<i>vitreous</i> and <i>resinous</i>, but <i>positive</i> and <i>negative</i>. The former
expressed by a <i>glance of approbation</i>, and the latter by a <i>flash of
disdain</i>. The different effects which discharges of these different
kinds of electricity exhibit in the subjects of experiment may be
rated among the most wonderful of phenomena. The former transports a
man, Southey-like, to “the atmosphere of the highest of all possible
heavens,” the latter sinks him “down! down! to the Domdaniel cave at
the roots of the ocean.” But as this is a branch of natural philosophy
to which, for forty years, past I have not paid the least attention,
I shall not attempt further to instruct your worships therein, but
refer you to the experiments so delectably set forth in the poems of
Little, Johannes Bonefonius, Secundus, and other adepts in that curious
science.</p>

<p class="p-left1">Sent me a bag full of his gas.</p>

<p>This wondrous soul-transporting modification of matter is christened by
chymists <i>gaseous oxyd of nitrogen</i>, and, as will be evident, from the
following sublime stanzas, and my judicious comments thereon (in which
I hold the <i>microscope</i> of criticism to those my peculiar beauties
which are not visible to the <i>naked eye</i> of common sense) is a subject
worthy the serious attention of the poet and physiologist.</p>

<p>Any “half-formed witling,” as Pope says (<i>Essay on Criticism</i>) “may
hammer crude conceptions into a sort of measured nonsense, vulgarly
called prose bewitched.” But the daring mortal, who aspires to “build
with lofty rhyme” an <i>Ævi Monumentum</i>, before he sets about the mighty
enterprise, must be filled with a sort of incomprehensible <i>quiddam</i>
of divine inflation. Then, if he can keep clear of Bedlam, and be
allowed the use of pen, ink, and paper, every line he scribbles, and
every phrase he utters, will be a miracle of sublimity. Thus one Miss
Sibyl remained stupid as a barber’s block, till overpowered by the
overbearing influence of Phœbus. But when</p>

<p class="p-left">the frantic gipsy muttered responses at once sublime, prophetic, and
unintelligible.</p>

<p>Indeed, this <i>furor mentis</i>, so necessary an ingredient in the
composition of the genuine poet, sometimes terminates in real madness,
as was unfortunately the case with Collins and Smart: Swift, Johnson,
and Cowper, were not without dismal apprehensions of a similar fate.
The wight, therefore, who wishes to secure to himself a sublunary
immortality by dint of poetizing, and happens not to be <i>poeta
nascitur</i>, must, like Doctor Caustic, in the present instance, seek a
sort of cow-pock-like substitute for that legitimate <i>rabies</i>, which
characterizes the true sons of Apollo.</p></div>

<p>Yes, gentlemen; among other great and wonderful events which we
foretold, but which never have happened, and moreover never will
happen, was the restoration of the Jews by the intervention of that
renowned pacificator, Buonaparte. We first prophecied, and many men
of our cast who had a knack at prying into futurity, echoed our
prediction, that the <i>pious</i> emperor of the Gauls would make Jerusalem
the head quarters of the Millennium, and under our auspices many a

<p class="p-left1">We transform dowdies into goddesses.</p>

<p>We here quote a passage from a popular writer merely to indicate our
utter disapprobation of the author and of his sentiments:</p>

<p>“The solicitude of parents, especially of mothers to make their
daughters fine ladies is truly ridiculous. How often soever the poor
child has occasion to look at anything below the parallel of the
horizon, and a little relax the muscles of the neck, it can hardly
ever escape the notice of her mamma or her governess, and she is bid
with more than common poignancy of expression, to hold up her head,
perhaps more than a thousand times in a day. If one of her shoulders
should be thought to rise but an hair’s breadth higher than the other,
she is immediately bound and braced, twisted and screwed, in a most
unmerciful manner, and tortured almost to death, in order to correct
the supposed irregularity. And lest the dear creature, in the natural
play and free use of her limbs, should contract any ungenteel habits,
the dancing master must be called in at least three times a week to put
every part of the body into its due place and attitude, and teach her
to sit, stand and walk according to the exact rules of his art, which,
to be sure, must infinitely exceed all the simplicity of untutored
nature. Should the least pimple appear on any part of the face, or
what is still more alarming, should the milk-maid’s flush begin to
betray itself in the color of the cheeks, all possible means must be
used, physic and diet must do their part, nay, health itself must be
endangered or destroyed to suppress the vulgar complexion.</p>

<p>“Health and beauty have been frequently destroyed by a solicitous
care to preserve them, deformity induced, and a thousand ill
habits contracted by the very means that were intended to prevent
them.”&mdash;<i>Ash’s Sentiments on Education.</i></p></div>

in their button and other wooden ware factory, by mixing with the usual
food, in the proportion of one third; that is, two parts of the usual
food and one part of saw dust; and that the hogs thrive full as well as
when fed in the usual way. From their experiments they are satisfied
that the saw-dust was digested by the animals, was nutritious, and
answered in all respects the purposes of the usual food.”</p></div>

<p class="p-left1">Illumed as one would light a candle.</p>

<p>In my younger days, I lived on terms of intimacy with Doctor Franklin,
highly honorable to both parties, as it showed we were both men of
discernment in choosing each a great man for his friend.</p>

<p>In a letter from that venerable sage, afterwards printed (<i>See
Franklin’s Works</i>, <i>p.</i> 115, <i>vol.</i> ii. <i>third edition</i>) he told <i>me</i>
that toads buried in sand, shut up in hollow trees, &amp;c. would live
forever, as it were; and, among other things, informed me of certain
curious facts about flies, which I will relate in his own words. “I
have seen an instance of common flies preserved in a manner somewhat
similar. They had been drowned in Madeira wine, apparently about the
time when it was bottled in Virginia, to be sent to London. At the
opening of one of the bottles, at the house of a friend where I was,
three drowned flies fell into the first glass which was filled. Having
heard it remarked that drowned flies were capable of being revived by
the rays of the sun, I proposed making the experiment upon these. They
were therefore exposed to the sun upon a sieve, which had been employed
to strain them out of the wine. In less than three hours two of them
began by degrees to recover life. They commenced by some convulsive
motions of the thighs, and at length they raised themselves upon their
legs, wiped their eyes with their fore feet, beat and brushed their
wings with their hind feet, and soon after began to fly, finding
themselves in Old England, without knowing how they came thither. The
third continued lifeless until sun-set, when, losing all hopes of him,
he was thrown away.</p>

<p>“I wish it were possible, from this instance, to invent a method
of embalming drowned persons, in such a manner that they might be
recalled to life, at any period, however distant; for having a very
ardent desire to see and observe the state of America a hundred years
hence, I should prefer to an ordinary death, the being immersed in a
cask of Madeira wine, with a few friends, until that time, then to be
recalled to life by the solar warmth of my dear country. But since, in
all probability, we live in an age too early, and too near the infancy
of science, to see such an art brought, in our time, to perfection, I
must, for the present, content myself with the treat which you are so
kind as to promise me, of the resurrection of a fowl or turkey cock.”</p></div>

<p class="p-left1">To healthier action than before.</p>

<p>I do not arrogate to myself the whole merit of this noble invention. Dr
Price and Mr Godwin, in divers elaborate works, especially the latter,
in his <i>Political Justice</i>, suggested some ideas which set my ingenuity
in such a ferment, that I could not rest quietly till I had brewed
a sublime treatise on the best mode of pulling down, repairing, and
rebuilding decayed and worn out animal machines.</p>

<p>I shall not attempt, in this place, to oblige your worships with
anything like a table of the contents of this judicious and profound
performance. I will, however, gratify your curiosity so far as to
glance cursorily at a few of the leading topics therein discussed and
illustrated, and slightly mention some of the immense advantages which
will be the result of this discovery.</p>

<p>In the first place, I make it apparent, by a long series of experiments
and scientific deductions, drawn therefrom, that it is very practicable
to enlighten the mind of a stupid fellow, by battering, boring, or
pulling his body to pieces.&mdash;Mr poet Waller’s authority is here to my
purpose, who tells us, that</p>

  <div class="poetry-container">
    <div class="poetry">
      <div class="stanza3">
        <div class="hangingindent">“The soul’s dark cottage <i>batter’d</i> and decay’d,</div>
        <div class="hangingindent">Lets in <i>new light</i> through chinks which time has made.”</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

<p>
Mr Gray, likewise, in his <i>Hymn to Adversity</i>, requests that “Daughter
of Jove” to impose <i>gently</i> her “iron hand,” and trouble him a <i>little</i>
with her “torturing hour,” although he appears disposed to avoid, if
possible, her more dismal accompaniments, such as her “Gorgonic frown,”
and the “funereal cry of horror.”</p>

<p>The Spaniards, under Cortes and Pizarro, managed much in the same way,
and enlightened the natives of the mighty empires of Peru and Mexico
in the great truths of Christianity, by killing a part, reducing the
remainder to a state of servitude, and battering their souls’ cottages
at their leisure. This process is in part expressed in a poetical
epistle, which I received not long since from my correspondent settled
at Terra del Fuego, in South America, who thus expresses the conduct of
some of his acquaintance, in converting the aborigines to Christianity.</p>

<p>I have read of a great mathematician, who was uncommonly stupid till
about the age of twenty, when he accidentally pitched head first into
a deep Well, fractured his skull, and it became necessary to trepan
him. After the operation it was immediately evident that his wit was
much improved, and he soon became a prodigy of intellect. Whether
this alteration was caused by “new light let in through chinks,” the
trapanning chisel had made, or whether the texture and position of the
brain were materially changed for the better in consequence of the jar
and contusion of the fall, I shall leave to some future Lavater, or any
other gentleman, who can gauge the capacity of a statesman, or a barrel
of porter, with equal facility, to determine.</p>

<p>2d. I proceed to demonstrate, that man being, as our most enlightened
<i>modern</i> philosophers allow, jumbled together by mere <i>chance</i> (a
blind; capricious goddess, who, half her time, does not know what she
is about) it is extremely easy to understand the principles of his
texture; because the mechanism of his frame is less intricate than that
of a common spit jack. Consequently, a Solomon or a Brodum can mend
this machine when deranged, as Well as a Harvey, a Sydenham, or a Mead.</p>

<p>3d. I proceed to prove, from analogy, with what facility this machine
may be disjointed, pulled to pieces, and again botched together. My
friend Mahomet had his heart taken out, a drop of black blood expressed
therefrom, and went about his common concerns next day as well as ever.
So when a sighing swain is taken desperately in love, he may lose all
his insides without any Very serious inconvenience. This I can attest
from <i>sad experience</i>, as, about forty years since, I was terribly in
for’t, with a sweet little sprig of divinity, whose elbow was ever
her most prominent feature, whenever I had the audacity to attempt to
approximate the shrine of her Goddesship.</p>

<p>4th. The important advantages, which will undoubtedly arise from this
invention, are almost too obvious to require explanation. I shall,
however, advert to a few.</p>

<p>By taking the animal machine to pieces, you may divest it of such
particles as clog its wheels, and render its motions less perfect. A
decayed, worn-out gallant may have <i>its</i> parts separated, thoroughly
burnished, botched together, and rendered as bright as a new-coined
silver sixpence. Thus my venerable Piccadilly friend, who, as Darwin
expresses it, sometimes “clasps a beauty in <i>Platonic</i> arms;” if he
should, fifty years hence, perceive that the mechanism of his frame is
rather the worse for wear, may come to Dr Caustic, and be rebuilt into
as fine a young buck as any in Christendom.</p>

<p>5th. Hereditary diseases may be thus culled from the constitution, and
gouty and other deleterious particles separated from those which are
sound and healthful.</p>

<p>Pride may be picked from the composition of an upstart mushroom of a
nobleman, impudence from a quack, knavery from a lawyer, moroseness
from a methodist, testiness from an old bachelor, peevishness from
an old maid; in short, mankind altered from what they are to what
they ought to be, by a method at once cheap, practicable, easy and
expeditious.</p>

<p>The only difficulty which has ever opposed itself to my carrying this
sublime invention to the highest possible pitch of perfection, has
been the almost utter impossibility of procuring any man, woman, or
child, who is willing to become the subject of operation. Now if either
of your worships would loan me his carcase to be picked to pieces,
and again botched together in the manner above stated, provided the
experiment should not fully succeed, I will engage to pay <i>all</i> the
damages thereby accruing to community, out of <i>one tenth</i> part of the
profits of this publication.</p></div>

<p class="p-left1">In mimic earthquakes, rain, and thunder!</p>

<p>Chymistry furnishes us with a method of manufacturing <i>artificial</i>
earthquakes, which will have all the great effects of those that are
natural. The old-fashioned receipt for an earthquake, however, of
iron filings and sulphur mixed in certain proportions and immersed in
the earth, I shall not take the trouble to state to your worships; as
most of you have, <i>perhaps</i>, read Mr Martin’s Philosophy nearly half
through. But my plan is to make such an earthquake as no mortal, except
Dr Darwin and myself, ever supposed possible. The former gentleman
made shift to explode the moon from the <i>southern</i> hemisphere of our
earth, and I propose to forward other moons by artificial earthquakes
of my own invention, from the <i>northern</i> hemisphere. I will give your
worships a specimen of Dr Darwin’s moon-producing earthquake, from
“<i>Botanic Garden</i>,” Canto I.</p>

<p>That Great Britain, not content with domineering on the surface,

<p class="p-left1">And if the theory of Babbage, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Charles Babbage, Esq. A. M., Lucasian Professor of Mathematics in
the University of Cambridge, [Eng.] and member of several academies,
has written and published a work <i>On the Economy of Machinery
and Manufactures</i>, which furnished that impulse to our <i>Organ of
Constructiveness</i> which eventuated in the accomplishment of the solid
gas manufactory above alluded to.</p>

<p>“In Iceland the sources of heat [to wit, hot springs, volcanoes, &amp;c.]
and their proximity seem almost to point out the future destiny of that
island. The use of its glaciers may enable its inhabitants to liquefy
the gases with the least expenditure of mechanical force; and the heat
of its volcanoes may supply the power necessary for their condensation.
Thus, in a future age, <i>power</i> may become the staple commodity of the
Icelanders, and of the inhabitants of other volcanic districts; and
possibly the very process by which they will procure this article of
exchange for the luxuries of happier climates, may, in some measure
tame, the tremendous element which occasionally devastates this
province.”</p>

<p>By our improvement, after the gases are condensed into a liquid, they
are made solid by the total abstraction therefrom of every particle of
caloric, insomuch that a thermometer, of our invention, with its bulb
in a ball of gas, indicated 999 degrees below 0 of Fahrenheit.</p></div>

<p class="p-left1">He wanted science to go through it.</p>

<p>Monsieur Citizen Volney, a sort of minor doctor Caustic, published a
circular letter, requesting the co-operation of men of similar views
and intellects with his own, to make observations on the course and
velocity of the winds, the times of their occurrence, &amp;c. in different
parts of the globe. The results of these observations he wished might
be forwarded to him at Paris, that he might therefrom be able to
complete a theory, which he had partly formed for calculating the tides
and currents of the atmosphere, with as much precision as those of the
ocean are now predicted.</p>

<p>Dr Franklin’s theories relative to this subject also deserve the meed
of metrical immortality. His tropical hurricanes, caused by a whirling
precipitance of cold air from the upper to the lower region of the
atmosphere are very fine phenomena. His <i>north east storms</i>, which,
on our continent, begin their operations at the <i>south west</i>, in
consequence of some extra rarefaction of air somewhere on or about the
isthmus of Darien, deserve a minute inspection. The ascent of rarefied
air at the equator, which makes its way to the poles, and visits us
in the form of a frigorific north-wester, as explained by Dr Darwin,
requires your worship’s high consideration. But we do not believe it
possible by a single impulse to project all this philosophy into your
right worshipful’s pericrania. You will, therefore, please wait till we

<p class="p-left1">Or stem a hurricane with ease.</p>

<p>“Many schemes” (it is said in Rees’s Cyclopædia, article Aerostation)
“have been proposed for directing the horizontal motion of balloons.
Some have thought of annexing sails to a balloon, in order to give it
the advantage of the wind; but to this proposal it has been objected,
that as the aerostatic machines are at rest with respect to the air
that surrounds them, they feel no wind, and consequently can derive no
benefit from the sails.” None but a conjurer, however, could have made
that discovery. But Dr Rees says further, that “An ingenious writer
observes, that the case of vessels at sea is quite different from that
of balloons; because that the former move with a velocity incomparably
less than that of the wind impelling them, on account of the resistance
of the water,” &amp;c. This ingenious writer must have had a new edition of
Friar Bacon’s head on his shoulders.</p>

<p>Our mode of steering a balloon is an improvement on the invention
of Professor Danzel, which is thus described by Dr Rees. “Professor
Danzel has constructed two cylinders, or axles, to the ends of which
are fixed, in the form of a cross, four sails or oars, moveable at the
point of their insertion in the cylinder, in such a manner, that when
made to move round by means of a handle, the eight oars, like the cogs
of a water mill wheel, present, successively, sometimes their flat side
and sometimes their edge,” &amp;c.</p>

<p>It is very possible that you may have heard of some of our American
mechanical geniuses, who have <i>sometimes come very nigh</i> to the art of
navigating boats against the stream by the force of the current. But
our invention is very materially different from that. We manage much
like a crab or lobster that paddles himself forward under water, and
proceeds as well as if he actually carried sail.</p></div>

<p class="p-left1">And its contagion is outrageous.</p>

<p>Some people, who appear to be fond of an opportunity of spoiling
a beautiful theory, have produced against contagion the following
arguments, and thereby very much perplexed a simple subject which
ought to have been decided solely by the <i>ipse dixit</i> of some famous
personage of the faculty.</p>

<p>1. The disorder is propagated more rapidly than could be possible on
the theory of contagion; as it spreads over a large city quicker than
the small pox would pervade a single alley.</p>

<p>2. It assimilates to itself all other diseases, and forces them to wear
its livery; which never is the case in contagious disorders.</p>

<p>3. It is destroyed by frost; but frost increases the activity of
contagion.</p>

<p>4. It is an endemic, and must have its own local atmosphere, beyond
whose limits it cannot be communicated. Thus the attendants of the sick
in <i>country</i> hospitals are never known to be infected.</p>

<p>These, and fifty other arguments of a similar nature, I overturn by the
weight of the authority of Dr Mead and other great men, which I have
found to be a concise and inclusive way of stopping the mouths of my
opponents.</p></div>

<p class="p-left1">We’ll turn out full moons by the hundred.</p>

<p>I do not think that one in forty of your worships has ever read the
“Theory of the Earth,” as first produced by James Hutton, M. D., F. R.
S., &amp;c. &amp;c. and thereafter much improved by professor Playfair. As it
would, however, be highly commendable for gentlemen of your honorable
profession not to rest with a superficial view of the great operations
of nature, I will accompany you as far as the centre of gravity, in a
journey of observation, for investigating the astonishing magazines of
burning materials which Dr Hutton and professor Playfair have furnished
us for the execution of our stupendous project.</p>

<p>1. You will obligingly take it for granted, or run the risk of spoiling
the Huttonian Theory, that the centre of the globe is a stupendous
furnace, a million times hotter than that of Nebuchadnezzar. That this
same heat, although it never amounts to a blaze, and wastes no fuel,
is sufficiently elastic to raise the continents from the bottom of the
main.&mdash;That having once raised or blown them up, as it were, like a
bladder, it is very careful not to let them down again, because as we
shall see by and by, they must all be “<i>disintegrated</i>,” alias washed
into the ocean.</p>

<p>2. Moreover, Dr Hutton’s followers will thank you to suppose that
all this matter, raised as aforesaid, consisted originally of
<i>unstratified</i> rocks, which, though they are properly called primitive
as the most ancient of the whole family of rocks, yet they are in fact
nothing better than the scrapings or “<i>disintegrations</i>” of primal
continents which existed before the commencement of the last edition of
the earth.</p>

<p>3. You will please to believe that all calcareous matters are formed
from the <i>detritus</i> of the primitive rocks, delivered by rivers into
the sea, and there, after having been modified by central heat,
protruded above water as before mentioned.</p>

<p>4. You will likewise be convinced that no metal, mineral, or <i>lapidose</i>
substance, can possibly be formed except at the bottom of the ocean, in
the laboratory of Dr Hutton.<a name="FNanchor_C_138" id="FNanchor_C_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_138" class="fnanchor">[C]</a></p>

<p>5. That although some foolish people have supposed that the sea has
been subsiding for centuries, yet, as we know that the continents are
crumbling into the ocean, you will conclude that we shall at length
find all our <i>dry</i> land under <i>water</i>, and the sea increased in
proportion to the square feet of earth deposited under its surface.</p>

<p>6. That it is evident that this central heat, having raised its
continents, and put proper supporters under them, will go to work in
due time, and raise new continents from the bottom of the ocean. Thus
the area of Dr Hutton’s centre will be enlarged, till the earth and
moon will come in contact, if our plan hereafter mentioned should not
check such progression. But we forbear, lest when it is ascertained
that “the present continents are all going to decay and their materials
descending into the ocean,” it may cause some disagreeable sensations
among our friends, who are speculators in American lands, whose
property, it seems, according to Dr Hutton’s theory, is about to take
French leave of its worthy proprietors.</p>

<p>When you have thoroughly <i>saturated</i> your faculties with this theory,
we will oblige you with a fresh <i>solution</i> from Dr Darwin, compounded
as follows:</p>

<p>“The variation of the compass can only be accounted for by
supposing the central parts of the earth to consist of a fluid
mass, and that part of this fluid is iron, which requiring a
greater degree of heat to bring it into fusion than glass or
other metals, remains a solid ore. The vis inertiæ of this
fluid mass with the iron in it occasions it to perform fewer
revolutions than the crust of solid earth over it; and thus
it is gradually left behind, and the place where the floating
iron resides, is pointed to by the direct or retrograde motion
of the magnetic needle.”</p></div>

<p class="p-left1">Of bellows made of Franklin’s air.</p>

<p>In the first paper of the third volume of Transactions of the American
Philosophical Society, you will find certain “Conjectures concerning
the formation of the earth,” &amp;c. in a letter from Dr B. Franklin, to
the abbe Soulavie; which we would prescribe as <i>tonics</i> to Hutton’s
<i>system</i>. The American sage informs us, that in the course of some
observations in Derbyshire, in England, he “imagined that the internal
part (of the earth) might be a fluid more dense, and of greater
specific gravity than any of the solids we are acquainted with; which,
therefore, might swim in or upon that fluid. Thus the surface of the
globe would be a shell, capable of being broken and disordered by any
violent movements of the fluid on which it rested. And as air has been
compressed by art so as to be twice as dense as water, in which case,
if such air and water could be contained in a strong glass vessel, the
air would be seen to take the lowest place, and the water to float
above and upon it;<a name="FNanchor_D_139" id="FNanchor_D_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_D_139" class="fnanchor">[D]</a> and as we know not yet the degree of density
to which air may be compressed; and M. Amontons calculated, that its
density increasing as it approached the centre in the same proportion
as above the surface, it would at the depth of&mdash;leagues be heavier
than gold, possibly the dense fluid occupying the internal parts of
the globe might be air compressed. And as the force of expansion in
dense air, when heated, is in proportion to its density; this <i>central
air might afford another agent to move the surface, as well as be of
use in keeping alive the subterraneous fires</i>; though, as you observe,
the sudden rarefication of water coming into contact with those fires
may also be an agent sufficiently strong for that purpose, when acting
between the incumbent earth and the fluid on which it rests.</p>

<p>“If one might indulge imagination in supposing how such a globe was
formed, I should conceive, that all the elements in separate particles
being originally mixed in confusion, and occupying a great space, they
would, as soon as the Almighty fiat ordained gravity or the mutual
attraction of certain parts and the mutual repulsion of other parts
to exist, all move towards their common centre: That the air being a
fluid whose parts repel each other, though drawn to the common centre
by their gravity, would be densest towards the centre and rarer as more
remote; consequently all matters lighter than the central part of that
air and immersed in it, would recede from the centre and rise till
they arrived at that region of the air which was of the same specific
gravity with themselves, where they would rest; while other matter,
mixed with the lighter air would descend, and the two meeting would
form the shell of the first earth, leaving the upper atmosphere nearly
clear.<a name="FNanchor_E_140" id="FNanchor_E_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_E_140" class="fnanchor">[E]</a> The original movement of the parts towards their common
centre, would naturally form a whirl there, which would continue in
the turning of the new formed globe upon its axis, and the greatest
diameter of the shell would be in its equator. If by any accident
afterwards, the axis should be changed,” [viz. by the impinging of a
Buffon’s comet’s tail or the delivery of a Darwin’s moon] “the <i>dense
internal fluid by altering its form must burst the shell</i> and throw all
its substance into the confusion in which we find it!” There’s an air
gun for your worships!</p>

<p>Now, if we did not possess a particular partiality for the sage who
formed this system, we should probably break up his Eolian cave, even
at the risk of creating half a hundred hurricanes. For should we open a
vent as large as a needle’s point into this magazine of compressed air,
you would instantly be assailed by “<i>another guess whistling</i>”<a name="FNanchor_F_141" id="FNanchor_F_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_F_141" class="fnanchor">[F]</a> than

<p class="p-left1">By Parker’s cement we’ll endeavor.</p>

<p>A composition has been invented by a Mr Parker, which bids fair to
become one of the most important discoveries which has signalized the
present century. The gentleman has compounded a cement or mortar,
which, by the mere action of the air, assumes in a week or two the
durability and consistence of the hardest marble and the firmest
stone, and may be applied to all the purposes to which the strongest
grained freestone is usually applied. Bridges, aqueducts, houses, and
we suppose pavements and roads, can be as well constructed of this
material as of the ordinary matters used in their composition. The
ornaments and articles usually made of marble can also be made of the
same materials, as it admits of a high polish, is incalculably cheaper,
just as durable, much lighter, and more easily worked. It is not
unlikely, that the waters of the Croton may be brought to New York in
pipes and aqueducts made of this article, as it would be so much more
economical than if transported thither in a canal of masonry, besides
that the new canal is impervious, never leaks, and consequently no
expenses for repairing would be ever incurred. There is not an article
used in household matters, or for public purposes that has formerly
been made of stone, but admits of the substitution of this cheaper and
lighter article; and we learn that the corporation have inspected the
manufacture, and are impressed with a proper sense of its importance
and applicability to civic purposes.&mdash;<i>N. Y. Mirror.</i></p></div>

<p class="p-left1">The foolish trash of Isaac Newton.</p>

<p>See <i>Studies of Nature</i>, by St Pierre, in which that scheming
philosopher has, with wonderful adroitness, swept away the cobweb
calculations of one Isaac Newton. Indeed, I never much admired the
writings of the last mentioned gentleman, for the substantial reasons
following.</p>

<p>In the first place, the inside of a man’s noddle must be better
furnished than that of St Pierre, or he will never be able to
comprehend them.</p>

<p>Secondly, it would be impossible to manufacture a system, like that of
St Pierre, accounting for the various phenomena of nature, in a <i>new</i>
and <i>simple</i> method, if one were obliged to proceed, like Newton, in
his <i>Principia</i>, in a dull, plodding, mathematical manner, and <i>prove</i>,
or even render <i>probable</i>, the things he asserts. But by taking some
facts for granted, without proof, omitting to mention such as militate
against a favorite theory, we may, with great facility, erect a
splendid edifice of “airy nothings,” founded on hypotheses without
foundation.</p>

<p>The said Isaac had taken it into his head that the earth’s equatorial
was longer than its polar diameter. This, he surmised from the
circumstance of a pendulum vibrating slower near the equator than near
the pole, and from finding that the centrifugal force of the earth
would not fully account for the difference between the time of the
vibrations at Cayenne and at Paris.</p>

<p>This, with other reasons equally plausible, led him to suppose that the
earth was flattened near the poles, in the form of an oblate spheroid,
and that a degree of latitude would, of consequence, be greater near
the pole than at the equator. Actual admeasurement coincided with that
conclusion.</p>

<p>The abbe St Pierre, however, possessing a most laudable ambition to
manufacture tides from polar ices, and thus to overturn Sir Isaac’s
theory relative to the moon’s influence in producing those phenomena,
and finding it somewhat convenient for that purpose to place his poles
at a greater distance from the centre of gravity than the equator,
accordingly took that liberty. He likewise had another substantial
reason therefor. Unless his polar diameter was longer than his
equatorial, the tides, being caused by the fusion of polar ices, must
flow up hill.</p>

<p>He therefore drew a beautiful diagram with which a triangle would
(according to the scheme of the author of <i>The Loves of the Triangles</i>,
improved from Dr Darwin’s <i>Loves of the Plants</i>) certainly fall in
love at first sight. (See page xxxiv. Pref. <i>Studies of Nature</i>.) In
displaying his geometrical skill in this diagram, however, he took care
to forget that there was some little difference between an <i>oblong</i> and
an <i>oblate</i> spheroid.&mdash;That flattening the earth’s surface, either in a
direction perpendicular or parallel to the poles, would <i>increase</i> the
length of a degree of latitude by <i>decreasing</i> the earth’s convexity.
That neither an oblate, nor an oblong spheroid was quite so <i>spherical</i>
as a perfect <i>sphere</i>. This was very proper, because such facts would
have been conclusive against his new Theory of the Tides.</p></div>

<p>If you wish, gentlemen, to know anything further relative to this

<i>Political Justice</i>, in which you will find almost as many sublime
and <i>practicable</i> schemes for meliorating the condition of man, as
in this very erudite work of my own. Let it not be inferred from my
not enlarging upon the present and other schemes of this philosopher,
that I would regard him as one whit inferior to any other <i>modern</i>
philosopher existing, not even excepting his friend Holcroft; but the
necessity of expatiating on the redundancy of Mr Godwin’s merits, is
totally precluded by the unbounded fame which his <i>chaste</i> productions

<p class="p-left1">First peer’d our continent through and through.</p>

<p>Citizen Volney made a very curious, simple, and convenient division of
the “Interior Structure” of North America, from certain specimens of
mineral substances, collected by this industrious pedestrian in a tour
of observation through the United States. Notwithstanding the immense
extent of territory which has come under citizen Volney’s cognizance,
and the short time which he did us the honor to reside and peregrinate
among us, we find that he was able to parcel our continent into
different interior departments, with as much precision as Buonaparte
showed in marking the different provinces of his empire. He gives us
“The granite region, the grit or sandstone region, the calcareous or
limestone region,” &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

<p>Now this division is the more ingenious, because it possesses no
foundation in nature; and therefore shows a wonderful invention in its
author. It happens, luckily for this fine theory, that granite is found
in wonderful abundance in the limestone region, and that throughout the
continent, in defiance of Mr Volney, we find that nature has jumbled
all his “regions” together. Nature, having made some confusion in this
way, has the more need of the assistance of modern philosophy to aid
her defective operations.</p></div>

<p class="p-left1">Of <i>graduated</i> French morality.</p>

<p>This gentleman published in America a small pamphlet, entitled, The
Law of Nature, or Principles or Morality, deduced from the Physical
Constitution of Mankind and the Universe. In this he tells us, “It
is high time to prove that morality is a physical and <i>geometrical</i>
science, and as such, susceptible, like the rest, of calculation and
mathematical demonstration.”</p>

<p>My friend, doctor Timothy Triangle, is much such another philosopher;
but has surpassed the Frenchman in the extent of his views, and made
systems which were entirely out of the reach of Mr Volney’s intellect.
Among others, was <i>a scale of national character</i>. By this, the
latitude and longitude of a place being given, and a sort of tare and
tret allowance made for adventitious circumstances, he could ascertain
the character of its inhabitants. The latitude of Paris, he affirmed,
was that of perfectibility made perfect, and most lucidly manifested
in the person of the <i>Liberty-loving</i> Emperor. Rise to the equator, or
recede to the pole from that parallel, and human nature dwindles in
arithmetical progression.</p>

<p>This gentleman was a great admirer of the principles of the French
revolution, and made out, mathematically, how much blood, horror, and
devastation would be necessary to give that predominance to France and
French principles, which would terminate in philosophy’s millennium.</p>

<p>Dr Triangle likewise made <i>geometrical scales</i> of morality; which were
not very essentially different from the principles of Volney. These
scales were adapted accurately to the interest, feelings, passions,
and prepossessions of the persons for whom they were intended, and so
<i>elastic</i> that they would stretch to suit any case, and authorize any
action which could be conceived or perpetrated.</p></div>

<p>Dr <span class="smcap">Francis Anthony</span>. The author of the <i>Biographia Britannica</i>
relates a pitiful tale respecting the persecutions suffered by this
obstinate old schismatic. “He was,” says that writer, “a very learned
physician and chemist, the son of an eminent goldsmith in London.
Was born April 16th, 1550. In 1569, he was sent to the university of
Cambridge; in 1574, took the degree of A. M. &amp;c. &amp;c. He began soon
after his arrival (in London) to publish to the world the effects of
his chemical studies. But not having taken the necessary precaution
of addressing himself to the College of Physicians for their license,
he fell under their displeasure; and being some time in the year 1600
summoned before the president and censors, he <i>confessed</i> that he
had practised physic in London for six months, and <i>had cured twenty
persons or more of several diseases</i>.” [A most atrocious crime! I trust
very few if any of your worships would be justified in <i>confessing</i> or
<i>pleading guilty</i> to a similar indictment.] “About one month after,
he was committed to the Counter prison, and fined in the sum of five
pounds <i>propter illicitam praxim</i>&mdash;that is, for prescribing against
the statutes of the college: but upon his application to the chief
justice, he was set at liberty, which gave so great an umbrage, that
the president and one of the censors waited on the chief justice to
request his favor in preserving the college privileges: upon which
Anthony submitted and promised to pay his fine, and was forbidden
practice. He was soon after accused again for practising physic, and
upon his own confession was fined another five pounds, which fine,
on his refusing to pay, was increased to twenty pounds, and he was
sentenced to be committed to prison till he had paid it. Nor was the
college satisfied with this, but commenced a suit at law against him,
in the name of the queen and college, in which they prevailed, and had
judgment against him. It appears that the learned society thought him
ignorant; but there were others of a different opinion, since, after
all these censures, and being tossed about from prison to prison, he
became doctor of physic in our own universities!”</p>

<p>This is the substance of the proceedings of our ancestors against the
arch-heretic; from which we learn the absolute necessity of a still
more rigorous prosecution of those disturbers of society, who have the
impudence to <i>cure</i> their patients without <span class="smcap">your License</span>. Had
this old fellow been hung, or “burnt off,” as he deserved, the business
would have been finished at once, and none would afterwards have dared
ever to call in question your supremacy!</p></div>

<p class="p-left1">Broke a whole gallipot of wrath!</p>

<p>I beseech you, gentlemen, to suspend your impatience relative to this
wonderful achievement, till you have <i>soared</i> through a few stanzas. In
the meantime, however, I wish that this my favorite hero, and burthen
of my song, should stand high with your worships, and be the object of
the humble admiration, not only of your honorable body, but of mankind
in general: and I, myself, shall take the liberty to trample on all
those, who dare call in question his infallibility. I have a knowledge
of but few, who more deserve to be trodden upon on this occasion than
the conductors of certain foreign literary journals, who, not aware of
the inconceivable services which Dr H. has rendered the medical host by
his ardent zeal against their common enemy, Perkinism, have expressed
their sentiments of him, and his works, with that indifference, which
must have arisen from their want of knowledge of his achievements.</p>

<p>Among the most prominent of this junto should be mentioned the <i>Medical
Repository</i>, at New York, conducted by professors Mitchell and Miller,
of that place, the former of whom I understand is a representative
in the Congress of the United States, an eminent physician, and the
celebrated author of what is usually termed the “Mitchellian Theory of
Contagion,” alterations in the French Chemical Nomenclature, &amp;c. The
latter, I am told, is likewise a physician of great respectability.</p>

<p>Now that two such characters should presume to represent Dr H. as
a man, whose “vanity is more conspicuous than his ability,” is a
circumstance which, while it excites my surprise, rouses my resentment.
However, to accomplish their disgrace and his renown, I shall concisely
state his magnanimous conduct to them, and their ungracious return.</p>

<p>Dr H. in great condescension to the poor wretches of the United
States, who, through the ignorance and <i>inexperience</i> of their medical
practitioners, were likely to be extirpated by the yellow fever,
addressed them in an affectionate letter, and proclaimed the barbarity
and unskilfulness of their physicians, in a very appropriate and
becoming manner. He even kindly apprized the Academy of Medicine,
at Philadelphia, that their proceedings and reasonings on the
disease among them were “frivolous, inadequate, and groundless,” and
communicated many other facts equally useful and important.</p>

<p>Now, whether his statements were true or false, those foreigners
ought to have been grateful to Dr H. for <i>honoring</i> them with the
information. But on the contrary, they say that “a poison, which, in
the city of New York, has destroyed, within three months, the lives
of more than twenty practitioners of medicine, well deserves to be
traced and understood by the survivors.” They even have the audacity to
assert, that “American physicians and philosophers, who have viewed the
rise and progress of pestilence, walked amidst it by day and by night,
year after year, and endured its violence on their own persons, almost
to the extinction of their lives,” ought to be as competent judges of
the cause and cure of the disease as Dr Haygarth, who has never seen a
case of it.</p>

<p>After entering into a copious (about 20 pages) and what they seem
to think a learned investigation of my great friend’s theory and
sentiments, they have dared to refute his reasoning, and turn it to
ridicule.</p>

<p>These presumptuous writers finally close their unreasonable account
of Dr Haygarth, in quotations from Dr Caldwell, who, it appears, is
a fellow of the college of physicians of Philadelphia, and a very
ungentleman-like <i>fellow</i> too, for he has also had the rashness to
descant on some of the works of Dr Haygarth in terms following.</p>

<p>“Perhaps he (Dr Haygarth) may found the boldness of his pretensions
as an author on the maturity of his years. Many writers less youthful
are more modest; and it is to be lamented that grey hairs give no
<i>infallible</i> earnest of either wisdom or liberality. We will not
positively assert that he is not a man of profound erudition; but we
have no reason whatever to convince us that he is. Perhaps he may pride
himself on being a native of the same country which produced a Harvey,
a Sydenham, a Cullen, and a Hunter. We entreat him to remember, that
weeds may infest the same ground which has been overshadowed by the
lordly adansonia, and that the same clime gives birth to the lion and
the jackal.” <i>Medical Repository</i>, vol. v. p. 333. Oh, fie! fie!</p></div>

<p class="p-left1">But Gifford comes, with why and wherefore.</p>

<p>The admirers of your <i>polite</i> poetry can never sufficiently
anathematize the author of the <i>Baviad and Mæviad</i> for extirpating,
root and branch, a species of sentimental ditty, which might be
scribbled, without the trouble of “sense to prose;” an object certainly
of no small consequence with your <i>bon ton</i> readers and writers of
rhyme. How could a <i>sentimental Ensign</i> or <i>love-lorn Lieutenant</i> be
better employed than in sobbing over “Laura’s tinkling trash,” or
weeping in concert with the “mad jangle of Matilda’s lyre?” Besides,
there ought to be <i>whipped syllabub</i> adapted to the palates of those
who cannot relish “Burns’ pure healthful nurture.” Mr Gifford should be
sensible, that reducing <i>poetry</i> to the standard of <i>common sense</i> is
clipping the wings of genius. For example; there is no describing what
sublime and Della Cruscan-like capers I should myself have been cutting
in this “Wilderness of suns;” for I was about to prepare a nosegay of
comets, and string the spheres like beads for a lady’s necklace; but
was not a little apprehensive lest Mr G. or some other malignant critic
should persuade the public, that my effusions of fancy were little
better than the rant of a bedlamite.</p></div>

<p class="p-left1">Behold! great Haygarth and his corps.</p>

<p>I here wish to give a concise sketch of the doctor’s necromantic
process, so well calculated to give the tractors the kick out of Bath
and Bristol, where they were rapidly making the most sacrilegious
encroachments on the unpolluted shrine of our profession. I would
recommend similar proceedings to every member of the college, and every
worthy brother who is truly anxious to preserve the dignity and honor
of the professional character. But would premise, that, when the like
experiments are made, which, I trust, will be very generally by the
whole profession, I would particularly recommend that the doctor’s
prudence, in not admitting any of the friends of the tractors at the
scene of action, should be strictly imitated; and also his discretion
in choosing, as subjects for the experiment, the ignorant and miserable
paupers of an infirmary, whose credulity will assist very much in
operations of this sort. I also enjoin them to bear in mind his <i>hint</i>,
“That if any person would repeat the experiment with <i>wooden</i> tractors,
it should be done with due solemnity; during the process, the wonderful
cures said to be performed by the tractors, should be particularly
related. Without these <i>indispensable</i> aids, other trials will <i>not</i>
prove so successful as those which are here reported.” <i>Haygarth’s
book</i>, page 4.</p>

<p>It can scarcely be necessary for me to hint to my discreet brethren, in
addition, that should they try the <i>real</i> tractors afterwards (which,
however, I rather advise them not to do at all) the whole of these
aids of the mind are to be as strictly avoided. I had like to have
forgotten to say, that the means used in the instance which follows to
increase the solemnity of the scene, were a capital display of wigs,
canes, stopwatches; and a still more solemn and terrific spectacle,
about a score of the brethren. The very commencement serves to show
how “<i>necessary</i>” was all this display to ensure the success of these
<i>wooden</i> tractors.</p>

<p>“It was often <i>necessary</i> to play the part of a <i>necromancer</i>, to
describe circles, squares, triangles, and half the figures in geometry,
on the parts affected, with the small end of the (wooden) tractors.
During all this time we conversed upon the discoveries of Franklin and
Galvani, laying great stress on the power of metallic points attracting
lightning, and conveying it to the earth harmless. To a more curious
farce I was never witness. We were almost afraid to look each other in
the face, lest an involuntary smile should remove the mask from our
countenances, and dispel the charm.” <i>Haygarth’s book</i>, page 16.</p>

<p>A very ingenious friend of Dr H. and the glorious cause in which he is
engaged, has conceived an improvement on this process. While the above
operation is going on, surely, the adroit necromancer would handle his
<i>virgula divinitoria</i> with far greater effect, and himself appear much
more in character, by using a suitable incantation. The following has,
therefore, been proposed for the general use of the profession.</p>

  <div class="poetry-container">

        <div>Hocus! pocus! up and down!</div>

  </div>

<p>Lest you should not have sufficient ingenuity to <i>comprehend</i> the
<i>object</i> of Dr Haygarth, in producing these operations on the minds
of those paupers, by the aid of such means as he employed, I must
<i>try</i> to explain it. It was to induce an inference on the part of the
public, that if, <i>by any means whatsoever</i>, effects can be produced on
the mind of a poor bedridden patient, whether such effect be favorable
or unfavorable (as the latter was often the case in Haygarth’s
experiments) <i>ergo</i>, Perkins’s tractors <i>cure</i> diseases by acting on
the mind also, whether on a human or brute subject. Should any person
be so uncivil and unreasonable as to start the objection to this logic,
that with the same propriety all medicines might also be supposed to
produce their effects by an action on the mind, I particularly advise
(provided such person be a noted coward) that you challenge him or
her to a duel: but if, on the contrary, he or she be a terrible Mac
Namara-like fellow, modestly reply that it was all a joke, and you hope
there was no offence.</p></div>

<p class="p-left1">In crows and infants, dogs and horses.</p>

<p>These are among the <i>patients</i> whose cures are attested in Perkins’s
publication, in which he has introduced them to show that his tractors
do not cure by an influence on the <i>imagination</i>. The fallacy of
any deductions, drawn from such cases, in favor of the tractors,
will be apparent from the following most <i>learned</i> and <i>elaborate</i>
investigation of the subject.</p>

<p>There are no animals in existence, I shall incontestably prove, that
are more susceptible of impressions from imagination, than those above
mentioned.</p>

<p>To begin with the <i>crow</i>. Strong mental faculties ever indicate a vivid
imagination; and what being, except Minerva’s beauty, the owl, is more
renowned for such faculties than the crow?&mdash;Who does not know that he
will smell gunpowder three miles, if it be in a gun, and he <i>imagine</i>
it be intended for his destruction? These emblems of sagacity, besides
“fetching and carrying like a spaniel,” and talking as well or better
than colonel Kelly’s parrot (which by the by I suspect to have been
a crow) are, as Edwards assures us in his <i>Natural History</i>, “the
planters of all sorts of wood and trees.” “I observed,” says he, “a
great quantity of crows very busy at their work. I went out of my way
on purpose to view their labor, and I found they were planting a grove
of oaks.” Vol. v. Pref. xxxv.</p>

<p>These <i>geniuses</i> always can tell, and always have told, since the days
of Virgil, the approach of rain. That poet says,</p>

  <div class="poetry-container">
    <div class="poetry">
      <div class="stanza3">
        <div class="hangingindent">“Tum <i>cornix</i> plena pluviam vocat improba voce.”</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

<p>They can likewise tell when bad news is approaching, as we learn from
the same writer,</p>

  <div class="poetry-container">
    <div class="poetry">
      <div class="stanza3">
        <div>“Sæpe sinistra cava prædixit ab ilice <i>cornix</i>.”</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

<p>Now I beg leave to know what mortal can do more? and to suppose a crow
not blessed with those more brilliant parts, under which <i>imagination</i>
is classed, is to do them a singular injustice, which I shall certainly
resent on every occasion.</p>

<p>Now as to <i>infants</i>. Whoever has been in the way of an acquaintance
with some of the more musical sort of these little gentry (like my
seven last darlings for instance) and has been serenaded with the
dulcet sonatas of their warbling strains, will not be disposed to deny
their powers on the imagination of <i>others</i>. I have known the delusion
practised so effectually by these young conjurers, that I have myself
<i>imagined</i> my head was actually aching most violently, even on the
point of cracking open; but on going beyond the reach of their magic
spell, that is, out of hearing, my head has been as free from pain as
it necessarily must be at this moment, while I am penning this lucid
performance. Now, I maintain it to be most unphilosophical, and totally
opposite to certain new principles in ethics, which I shall establish
in a future publication, to suppose that infants should be able to
impart either pleasure or pain, by operating on the imagination, and
not themselves possess a large share of that imagination, by the aid of
which they operate to so much effect upon others.</p>

<p>Next come <i>dogs</i>. Dr Shaw, in his <i>Zoology</i>, vol. i. p. 289, informs
us, “that a dog belonging to a nobleman of the Medici family always
attended his master’s table, changed the plates for him, carried him
his wine in a glass placed on a salver, without spilling the <i>smallest</i>
drop.” The celebrated Leibnitz mentions another, a <i>subject</i> of the
elector of Saxony, <i>who</i> could discourse in an “intelligible manner,”
especially on “tea, coffee, and chocolate;” whether in Greek, Latin,
German, or English, however, he has not stated; but Dr Shaw, alluding
to the same dog, says, undoubtedly under the influence of prejudice,
“he was somewhat of a truant, and did not willingly exert his talents,
being rather pressed into the service of literature.”</p>

<p>Indeed, our greatest naturalists assure us, that this animal is far
before the human species in every ennobling quality. Buffon makes man
a very devil compared with the dog; and had he come directly to the
point, I presume he would have told us that the dog is one link above
man in the great chain from the fossil to the angel. “Without the dog,”
says Buffon, “how could man have been able to tame and reduce other
animals into slavery? To serve his own safety, it was necessary to make
friends among those animals whom he found capable of attachment. <i>The
fruit of associating with the dog</i> was the conquest and <i>the peaceable
possession of the earth</i>. The dog will always preserve his empire. He
reigns at the head of a flock, and makes himself <i>better</i> understood
than the voice of the shepherd” (well he might, for it appears he
is more knowing, more powerful, and more just.) “Safety, order, and
discipline, are the fruits of his vigilance and activity. They are a
people submitted to his management, whom he conducts and protects, and
against whom he never employs force but for the preservation of peace
and good order.” <i>Barr’s Buffon</i>, vol. v. p. 302.</p>

<p>It is to me somewhat remarkable that <i>theorizing</i> Frenchmen, many of
whose discoveries are scarcely less important than my own, cannot
make them apply in such a manner as to effect some <i>practical good</i>
in society. Buffon discovered that a dog was a species of demi-god,
and appears on the point of worshipping this great Anubis of the
Egyptians. Voltaire tells us, that Frenchmen are half monkey and half
tiger, and everybody knows that the one is insufferably mischievous,
and the other infinitely ferocious. Now it is surprising that these
philosophers could not contrive to improve the breed by a little of
the <i>canine</i> blood. Indeed, I should advise them to import some of our
Bond street male <i>puppies</i>, to be paired with French female <i>monkeys</i>,
and I will venture to assert that there will be very little of the
<i>tiger</i> perceivable in their offspring. And since a dog, as Buffon
says, “reigns with so much dignity at the head of a flock, will always
preserve his empire, <i>never employs force but for the preservation
of peace and good order</i>,” and is endowed with so many other great
qualifications, which seem to denote him to be a proper personage
to wield the sceptre of dominion, I would seriously advise the abbe
Sieyes, when he frames his 999th Constitution for the <i>free</i> French
Republic (which it is said he has already begun to manufacture) so to
organize the executive branch, that at least one of the consuls should
be a true blooded English bull-dog.</p>

<p>After the ample proof I have now given of the infinite superiority of
the dog to man, when his merits are fairly estimated, which it is very
difficult for us, being interested, to do without prejudice, I shall
take it for granted, that he must possess all the brilliancy even of a
poet’s imagination, and therefore that he is far <i>more</i> likely to be
cured by imagination than man.</p>

<p>It now remains to speak of <i>horses</i>, and these (not to mention
the Bucephalus of Alexander, or the Pegasus of doctor Caustic) I
shall show, in a very few words, can boast of performances and
qualifications, to which a lively fancy in the comparison is but
as the wit of an oyster to the wisdom of a philosopher. One of the
most scientific nations that ever existed, renowned alike for its
refinements in the arts, and prowess in war, has been compelled to
yield the palm to the superior attainments of a horse, and acknowledge
its inability to achieve what he most readily effected. Ten long
years was the whole power of Greece engaged in an ineffectual siege
of far-famed Troy. The bravest of armies, commanded by heroes allied
to the gods, assailed the foe in vain. At this disheartening period
stepped forth a <i>wooden</i> horse, and promised a victory, provided his
plans were adopted. Aware of the horse’s <i>great capacity</i>, which
enabled him to <i>comprehend</i> a great number of <i>subjects</i>, the sagacious
Greeks <i>entered into</i> his measures, and Troy was levelled in the dust.</p>

<p>If all this could have been accomplished by a <i>wooden</i> horse, none
but a Perkinite will be so absurd as to pretend that one composed of
<i>flesh and blood</i>, like man, does not enjoy far greater privileges,
among which are those of receiving as many cures by the influence of
imagination as he pleases.</p>

<p>Now then, gentlemen, I trust that if any man will con over, digest,
comprehend, and <i>admit</i> this my ingenious and learned exposition of
the fallacy of the arguments in favor of the tractors, so much harped
upon by our adversaries, which are drawn from the circumstance of their
having cured crows and infants, dogs and horses, he will with great
facility be enabled to confound and overthrow them on all occasions,
provided he enforce and proclaim it with the ardency its importance
deserves.</p></div>

<p>So said the learned bishop Berekley, in a scientific treatise called

apparent, to those who have a clue to his metaphysical labyrinth,
that there is no such thing as matter, entity, or sensation, distinct
from the mind which perceives, or thinks it perceives, such ideas or
substances. The bishop’s authority being so pat in point, I cannot but
admire that it has not more frequently been adduced in opposition to
the tractors.</p></div>

A great hue and cry has been raised by the Perkinites, by which some
of the less penetrating part of the profession have been awed into
silence, respecting the <i>duty</i> of medical practitioners. They say that
it is the duty of a medical man to employ only such means as will cure
his patient in the most <i>safe</i>, <i>cheap</i>, and <i>expeditious</i> manner. This
infamous pretension takes its origin from no other person than Perkins
himself. That you may individually be aware of the effrontery with
which it is brought forward, I shall, in this note, copy from Perkins’s
book his manner of treating the subject. Your worships will form some
idea of the magnitude of this objection of our adversaries, in their
own estimation, and the mischief it has already occasioned, not only
in Great Britain, but abroad, when I inform you that it has been
echoed in both the English and foreign journals, and in many of them
treated as a complete refutation of the arguments of Dr Haygarth, and
of all who object against the tractors, on account of their <i>curing</i>
diseases merely by operating on the imagination. Among other foreign
publications, I observe that the 21st volume of the <i>Bibliothèque
Britannique</i>, printed at Geneva, closes a long account (40 pages) of
“<i>Perkinisme</i>” with this “petite histoire de Mr Perkins.”</p>

<p>“A gentleman came from the country to London, for the advantage
of medical assistance, in a complaint of peculiar obstinacy and
distress. After being under the care of an eminent physician several
weeks, and paying him upwards of thirty guineas, without any relief,
he was induced to try the tractors. To be short, they performed a
remarkable cure; the person was perfectly restored in about ten days.
The physician, calling soon after, was informed of the circumstance.
He began lamenting that so sensible a person as the patient should
be caught in the use of so contemptible a piece of quackery as the
tractors. After assuring the patient that he had thrown away his five
guineas, for that it was well established by Dr Haygarth, that a
brick-bat, tobacco-pipe, goose-quill, or even the bare finger, would
perform the same cures, he was interrupted by his patient: ‘And are
you sincere in your belief that you could have produced, by those
means, the same effects upon me, which I have experienced from the
tractors?’ ‘Do I believe it? Ay, I know it; and that a thousand similar
cures might be effected by means equally simple and ridiculous.’ ‘And
sir,’ interrupted the gentleman again, in a more stern and serious
tone, ‘why did you not cure me then, by those <i>simple</i> means? Remember
I have paid you thirty guineas, under the supposition that you were
exerting your utmost endeavors to cure me, and that in the most safe,
cheap, and expeditious manner. You now, in substance, acknowledge,
that, although in possession of the means of restoring me to health,
for the dishonorable purpose of picking my pocket, you continued me
upon the bed of sickness! Who turns out to be the impostor? Let your
own conscience answer.’ The justness of the retort, it will be easily
believed, precluded the possibility of an exculpation.” <i>Perkins’s New
Cases</i>, p. 145.</p>

<p>Had I been the physician, however, I would have rejoined with
arguments, not dissimilar to that which is so beautifully expressed
in the above stanza. I would have told him that the Author of nature
most certainly would not have created either a poisonous or salubrious
vegetable, without intending that it should “dose and double dose” his
creature man.</p>

<p>Should it be objected that the tractors being also <i>created</i> substances
ought also to be used, I could ingenuously retort, they were created
in America, a country whose natives are Indians, an inferior order of
beings to man, as some great philosophers before me have asserted, and
who, it is evident, are the <i>only</i> order of creatures, on whom it was
intended the tractors should be used.</p>

<p>I have no particular wish to injure Dr Jenner, or I should positively
overturn him and all his adherents with my resistless arguments. If
I were not willing that he should retain his popularity, I should
make it appear that the small-pox was created with the intent of
being universally propagated among the human race for the purpose of
mortifying female vanity; and Jenner’s attempt to extirpate it, by
substituting the cow-pox, which ought to have been confined to the
quadrupeds, among which it originated, as the tractors ought to have
been to the Indians, is the extreme of presumption, and the height of
iniquity. I cannot but conceive that our bishops and clergy are very
remiss in not endeavoring to dissuade from such enormous, innovating
practices.</p></div>

<p class="p-left1">That learn’d physicians pine with hunger.</p>

<p>No man who possesses a <i>heart</i>, certainly none who possesses <i>bowels</i>,
can view us reduced to this deplorable condition, and hear this
pathetic appeal, without the sincerest commiseration. The eminent
services that our profession have rendered mankind, in contributing
to avert some of the greatest curses that ever befel the civilized
part of the world, are too well known, and have been too frequently
acknowledged to be forgotten, ungratefully, in the day of our
adversity. The testimony to this effect of the judicious, the humane
Addison, ought often to be brought before the public eye.</p>

<p>“We may lay it down as a maxim,” says that intelligent writer, “that
when a nation abounds with physicians it grows thin of people. Sir
William Temple is very much puzzled to find out a reason why the
northern hive, as he calls it, does not send such prodigious swarms,
and overrun the world with Goths and Vandals, as it did formerly: but
had that excellent author observed that there were no students in
physic among the subjects of Thor and Woden, and that this science very
much flourishes in the north at present, he might have found a better
solution for this difficulty than any of those he has made use of.”

<p>This would be abominable. Physicians, in general, are a hale hearty
race of men, as, indeed, must be readily conceived from their prudent
maxims in regard to the preservation of their <i>own</i> health:&mdash;they take
no physic. No; they are too well acquainted with its tendency. Now, to
starve so sturdy and powerful a body, when his majesty is in want of
such subjects to check the ambitious strides of restless Buonaparte,
as appears from the king’s declaration of this day (May the 16th,
1803,) in preference to letting their miserable <i>patients</i> expire, whom
Providence evidently intended should die off, is, I trust, too absurd
and unreasonable an idea to be admitted.</p></div>

<p class="p-left1">Except by knaves retired from practice.</p>

<p>This, gentlemen, is a circumstance of no small moment, and which I
trust you will see the necessity of looking at with some seriousness.
Some of our profession have, to their eternal disgrace, since their
retirement on their fortunes, deserted our cause, and are now to be
found in the ranks of our enemies. These fellows have the presumption
to suggest that their duty to the interests of the community supersedes
that which they owe to their old brethren, the unreasonableness of
which sentiment I conceive to be self-evident, and therefore shall
not trouble myself to prove it. Several have even addressed to the
Perkinean Institution communications in favor of the metallic tractors,
for publication, three of which are already laid before the public.
The first on this list is Mr Lyster, late of Dublin, who having been
above twenty years senior surgeon of the Dublin hospital, retired to
Bath, where he now seems even to take delight in benefitting the mean
and miserable poor, to wanton injury of his own dear brethren. To show
the extent of his malice, he has, in his communication to the Perkinean
Society, introduced statements of remarkable cures by the tractors;
among others one of total blindness of many years duration, in which
all medical skill had previously failed; and, to wind up this tale of
infamy, he has even ventured to censure, indirectly, my great champion,
Dr Haygarth, and to hint that his proceedings were not accompanied with
honorable intentions!</p>

<p>Next on this trio list are Mr Yatman, of Chelsea, and Dr Fuller, of
Upper Brook street; the conduct of both of whom is equally, if not
more reprehensible than Lyster’s. These two also call in the lame,
the halt, and the blind, and, as if to spite their brethren who have
drugs to sell, cure them with the tractors without fee or reward! Such
conduct is so atrocious that if your worships should think proper to
have them indicted, and Mr Erskine or Mr Garrow object to defend the
cause of such clients, I, counsellor Caustic (remember I am LL.D.) will
manage it for you, and, provided I can but get that same jury which
decided that captain Macnamara was not accessory to the death of Col.
Montgomery, I will procure the defendants to be sent to Botany Bay, or
at least as far as Coventry.</p>

<p>To show the barbarity and wantonness of these two men, I will close
this note by the following quotation from the letter of one of them,
Dr Fuller, who, after a practice of nearly thirty years in medicine,
and by which he has secured his own independence, seems now to amuse
himself in undermining those of us who are still dependant. After a
statement of a number of great cures by the tractors, and proving, by
his own trials on infants, &amp;c. that they do not act on imagination,
which Dr Haygarth so laudably attempted to show, he proceeds:&mdash;“I
derive much satisfaction in noticing among the more liberal and
respectable part of my profession an increased favorable opinion of
Perkinism, and a readiness to <i>allow</i> of its use among their patients,
when proposed by <i>others</i>. To expect more than this, would be to expect
more than human nature in its present state will admit. It must be an
<i>extraordinary</i> exertion of virtue and humanity for a medical man,
whose livelihood depends either on the sale of drugs, or on receiving
a guinea for writing a prescription, which must relate to those drugs,
to say to his patient, ‘You had better purchase a pair of tractors
to keep in your family; they will cure you without the expense of my
attendance, or the danger of the common medical practice.’ For very
obvious reasons, medical men must <i>never</i> be expected to recommend the
use of Perkinism. The tractors must trust for their patronage to the
enlightened and philanthropic out of the profession, or to medical men
retired from practice, and who know of no other <i>interest</i> than the
luxury of relieving the distressed. And I do not despair of seeing the
day, when but very few of this description as well as private families
will be without them.” If Dr Fuller were obliged to live in my garret
one month, he would sing a different tune.</p></div>

<p>Besides the advantage of showing how reverently this great philosopher
and philanthropist could speak of religion, I am sure I shall render
an essential service to agriculturists, by adducing the following
quotation. I bring it forward the more readily, as I find that the
Board of Agriculture have been so negligent of the interest of that
noble art, as not yet to have recommended the universal adoption of
this measure.</p>

<p>“There should be no burial places in churches, or churchyards, <i>where
the monuments of departed sinners shoulder God’s altar</i> and pollute his
holy places with dead men’s bones. But proper burial places should be
consecrated out of towns, and divided into two compartments, the earth
from one of which, saturated with animal decomposition, should be taken
away once in ten or twenty years <i>for the purposes of agriculture</i>, and
sand or clay, or less fertile soil brought into its place.” <i>Darwin’s
Phytologia</i>, p. 242.</p>

<p>Here your worships will perceive that there is a prospect, if this
advice is followed, that we may enjoy the privilege of <i>eating</i>,
instead of <i>drinking</i> our friends, which would be something of an
improvement on our idea, communicated in page 58.</p></div>

<p>Among other speculations also in the cause of humanity, bequeathed us
by this <i>friend</i> of <i>man</i>, are the following, which will prove a great
consolation to those who have foolishly supposed that the bloodshed
and devastation, produced by war, were circumstances which ought to be
lamented.</p>

<p>These remarks are published by Dr Darwin, as written under his own
observations in the manuscript of his book, by a “<i>philosophical</i>
friend,” whom he left in his library. It is supposed, however, that the
doctor wrote them himself. At least the sentiments have his sanction.</p>

<p>“It consoles me to find, as I contemplate the whole of organized
nature, that it is not in the power of any one personage, whether
statesman or hero, to produce by his ill employed activity, so much
misery as might have been supposed. Thus, if a Russian army, in these
insane times, after having endured a laborious march of many hundred
miles, is destroyed by a French army, in defence of their republic,
what has happened? Forty thousand human creatures, dragged from their
homes and connexions, cease to exist, and have <i>manured</i> the <i>earth</i>;
but the quantity of organized matter, of which they were composed,
presently revives in the forms of millions of microscopic animals,
vegetables, and insects, and afterwards of quadrupeds and men; <i>the
sum of whose happiness is, perhaps, greater than that of the harrassed
soldier, by whose destruction they have gained their existence</i>! Is not
this a consoling idea to a mind of universal sympathy? I fear you will
think me a misanthrope, but I assure you a contrary sensation dwells in
my bosom; and though I commiserate the evils of all organized beings,
“<i>Homo sum, humani nihil a me alienum puto</i>.”” <i>Phytologia</i>, p. 558.</p></div>

<p>If your worships have not read Mr Malthus’s Essay on the Principles
of Population, I advise you to buy the book immediately, and set
yourselves about something like an effort to comprehend its contents.
You will there find, I cannot now recollect the page, that <i>population</i>
has a tendency to increase in a <i>geometrical ratio</i>, but that
<i>subsistence</i> must be limited to an <i>arithmetical ratio</i>. That the
world would soon swarm with inhabitants in such a manner that in years
of the greatest plenty we should be under the disagreeable necessity of
turning <i>anthropophagi</i>, and, like the famous Pantagruel, eat pilgrims
with our salad, were not the principle of population restrained by
two <i>very useful predominant principles</i>, viz. “<span class="smaller">VICE</span> and
<span class="smaller">MISERY</span>;” the former of which is happily exemplified in the
extravagance and luxury of your worships, and the latter correctly
expressed in the <i>poverty</i> of your worships’ petitioner. You will
likewise find in the same volume, <i>passim</i>, that after war, pestilence,
and famine have laid waste a country, there is an immediate increase
of births, in consequence of the principle of population being let
loose to take its natural operation in replenishing the earth; or, in
other words, because there is more <i>elbow room</i> for the survivors. Now,
this being correct reasoning, it must be wonderfully wrong to try to
keep alive poor folks, who are a dead weight on population, destroy
the means of subsistence, prevent early marriages, and, by keeping
themselves above ground, stand in the way of their betters.</p></div>

<p class="p-left1">The poker take and lay them level.</p>

<p>Please not imagine that I would be understood to recommend this “retort
courteous” in the most unqualified sense, or that it be exercised on
every occasion. On the contrary, the due performance of it will require
no small degree of prudence and discretion. Indeed, I would have you
use the <i>poker</i>, or any other violent and <i>weighty</i> arguments of this
kind, only when your antagonist happens to be a woman, a child, or some
debilitated and cowardly wretch who will submit without any chance of
your meeting with unpleasant resistance.</p>

<p>As to the justice of this mode of response, there exists no doubt,
and therefore dread no decisions <i>in foro conscientiæ</i>, because the
extreme heinousness of your adversaries’ provocation will appear from
the following consideration. To deprive you of an argument, for which
you have sacrificed everything dear to obtain, must, confessedly be
regarded as a most outrageous proceeding. Now, this is exactly the case
in the present instance; for in your attempt to show that medical men
believe and trust in no medicine, the <i>modus operandi</i> of which they
do not comprehend, you make a sacrifice of <i>truth</i>, <i>decency</i>, and
<i>common sense</i>, the full reward of which sacrifice you ought to enjoy
unmolested. That no man can explain how mercury poisons, bark cures
an intermittent fever, or opium produces sleep, is confessed by every
medical author; and that all these should be used in our practice,
without any hesitation, I never heard any person deny, and for this
proper and substantial reason; their administration is <i>profitable</i>
to the faculty. I have therefore to repeat, that when the Perkinites
complain of your rejecting the use of tractors, because their <i>modus
operandi</i> cannot be entirely explained, although you adopt the use of
drugs, the operation of which is equally or more inexplicable, your
sacrifice in support of your ground is so great, that whoever attempts
to drive you from such ground deserves to be laid low with the first
weapon that comes to hand.</p></div>

<p class="p-left1">Will e’en <i>bewitch</i> the <i>operator</i>.</p>

<p>No part of the learned doctor’s management, in the anti-Perkinistic
cause, merits higher eulogy than this most <i>rational</i> explanation of
that most <i>irrational</i> practice. So <i>cogently</i> does an innate principle
of equity control me, that I am absolutely <i>coerced</i> to offer, at
the shrine of the heroic doctor, my tributary dole of the incense
of admiration, for having presented our profession such a powerful
knock-me-down argument, wherewith to buffet the common enemy.</p>

<p>The sagacious doctor having published a scientific treatise against the
tractors, demonstrating that “they act on the <i>patient’s</i> imagination,”
Perkins, came out in reply, with all the fury of an Irish rebel, and
declared that the doctor deserved to be trounced for not suffering
his readers to know, that the tractors pretended to cure infants and
brute animals, though numerous cases to that effect had then been
published; and in that reply proclaimed that Dr H. purposely endeavored
to suppress such facts, that he might, with greater facility, induce
the public to swallow the deductions drawn from his magical manœuvres
in the Bath and Bristol hospitals. Now, admitting the doctor managed in
this way, I am sure he was perfectly right in so doing. The <i>end</i> in
view, according to established principles of <i>modern</i> morality, will
ever justify the <i>means</i> taken to accomplish that end. In this case,
the end in view was most important&mdash;nothing less than the downfall
of Perkinism, and the consequent aggrandizement of our profession.
Should any of our opponents be so captious as to assert, that such
principles and such motives of action should not be encouraged in
society&mdash;that they have a pernicious tendency, and other nonsense of
that sort, I must take the liberty to refer them to the first consul of
the French republic, whose conduct has ever been modelled according to
the principles above stated, and who is certainly the most <i>powerful
logician</i> of the age, perfectly able to confound those who shut their
eyes against the light of conviction.</p>

<p>But to revert to the doctor’s treatise, and Perkins’s impudent
replication. The man who could raise the very old gentleman himself,
by the legitimate powers of necromancy, was not so easily defeated.
Accordingly he returns to the charge in another edition&mdash;admits the
existence of the numerous cases on infants, horses, &amp;c. but lays them
all level with the following unanswerable argument.&mdash;“The proselytes of
Perkinism having been driven from every other argument, have, as a last
resource, alleged that the patent metallic tractors have removed the
disorders of infants and horses. Even this <i>flimsy</i> pretence is capable
of a satisfactory refutation. In these cases it is not the <i>patient</i>,
but the <i>observer</i>, who is deceived by his own imagination!!!” See
<i>Haygarth’s book</i>, page 40. <i>Mirabile dictu!</i></p></div>

<p class="p-left1">Then quote his lady’s <span class="smaller">ECCHYMOSIS</span>.</p>

<p>The celebrated story of the lady’s ecchymosis comes handed down to your
worships by five successive reporters. The lady <i>incog.</i> who makes so
<i>conspicuous</i> a figure in Dr Haygarth’s narration, told another lady,
who told a medical friend of Dr H. who told Dr Caustic, who tells
your worships this important anecdote. Now, as “in the multitude of
counsellors there is <i>safety</i>,” so in a multitude of reporters there is
<i>certainty</i>. But to the story; which I shall give in the language of Dr
H.’s medical friend aforesaid.</p>

<p>“A <i>lady</i> informed me, that a <i>lady</i> of her acquaintance, who had great
faith in the efficacy of the tractors, on seeing a small <i>ecchymosis</i>,
about the size of a <i>silver penny</i>, at the corner of the eye, desired
to try on it the effect of her favorite remedy. The <i>lady</i>, who was
intended to be the subject of the trial, consented, and the <i>other
lady</i> produced the instruments, and, after drawing them four or five
times over the spot, declared that it changed to a paler color; and
on repeating the use of them a few minutes longer, that it had almost
vanished, and was scarcely visible, and departed in high triumph at
her success. I was assured by the <i>lady</i> who underwent the operation,
that she looked in the glass immediately after, and that not the least
visible alteration had taken place!!” (From <i>Haygarth’s</i> book, page 40.)</p>

<p>I had determined to exert my influence in all the medical societies,
that the above case be read at the opening of each meeting, until there
should not be left of the tractors, in this island, “a wreck behind.”
But a far better plan of Dr H. himself has precluded the necessity
of this measure, which was to announce in all the advertisements of
his book in the public papers, that “it explains why the disorders of
infants and horses are said to have been cured by the tractors.” See
his daily advertisements in the papers.</p>

<p>Indeed, I am at a loss which to admire most, the pretty fanciful
relation above cited, which is all the new edition of the doctor’s
treatise against the tractors contains to justify the assertion in the
advertisements before mentioned, or his singular skill in constructing
such a fabric on this foundation. Did I possess the talents of the
doctor in the advertising department, I should announce this my pithy
performance to the public, by publishing in all the papers, that the
price of the tractors was, in consequence of Dr Caustic’s opposition,
fallen to the price of old iron, and Perkins’s pamphlets having been
proscribed by physicians, were condemned, and actually burnt by the
hangman on execution-day, at the Old Bailey, in the presence of every
individual of the college of physicians, and half the citizens of
London.</p>

<p>I would beg leave to add to this incomparable Haygarthian demonstration
an argument of my own, which I think is not less powerful. It is
impossible that these tractors should perform any <i>real</i> cure, as
they act <i>solely</i> on the <i>imagination</i> either of the patient or the
operator. But cures performed by the power of <i>imagination</i> must be
<i>imaginary</i> cures, that is, no cures at all.</p></div>

<p>It is not true, as some sagacious coffee-house politicians have
asserted, that madame Hoax (or more correctly double Hoax) is the
wife of a Chinese Mandarin, settled on the mountains of the Moon, in
Abyssinia, for the purpose of ascertaining the influence of imagination
in the cure of diseases. No, gentlemen, she is a baroness of true
English breed, more sturdy than a Semiramis, a Penthesilea, or a Joan
of Arc, and will prove, in our cause, a championess of pre-eminent
prowess. Should your worships wish for further acquaintance with this
lady, which in my opinion would be for your mutual advantage, you will
take the trouble to inquire at my garret, No. 299, Dyot street, St
Giles’s (having removed from my former place of residence, third floor,
327, Grub street, with a view of being nearer my friend, Sir Joseph, in

<p>I am now preparing a most awful tragedy for Drury lane theatre (Mr
Sheridan’s approbation being already obtained) to be entitled and

I have no doubt will be so celebrated as to be the theme of every
ballad-singer in the metropolis. I cannot forbear anticipating some
small share of that applause, which I have reason to suppose will be
<i>piled</i> on Dr Caustic, as soon as he is publicly known as the author of
such an inimitable production, by obliging your worships with a <i>part</i>
of the chorus to the song aforesaid.</p>

<p>An old lady of my acquaintance was actually advised by an <i>ingenious</i>

swallow tractors for an internal complaint. If our profession were to

<p class="p-left1">In wilds where science ne’er was thought on.</p>

<p>That is, in the United States of America, among Indians and Yankees.
You will find, gentlemen, much to the purpose relative to the state
of science, where Perkinism originated, in the <i>Monthly Magazine</i>,
of January, 1803, under the title of “Animadversions on the present
state of literature and taste in the United States, communicated by
an English gentleman lately returned from America.” This gentleman
gives information that the Americans are wretchedly “<i>behind</i>-hand in
science <i>with</i> the Britains.” Indeed, those transatlantic younkers
ought, in half a century, to have established universities and other
seminaries of learning, at least as <i>old</i> and respectable as those of
Oxford and Cambridge, and which should have graduated as many students
and produced as many great men. As to the parsimonious spirit of
Americans in encouraging science (which this gentleman animadverts
upon with laudable indignation) it ought truly to be exclaimed against
by us Englishmen, for the weighty reason following: Great Britain,
“from time whereof the memory of man runneth not to the contrary” (as
judge Blackstone says) hath starved some of her first poets; such for
instance as Butler, Otway, Chatterton, Dryden, Savage, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.
&amp;c. consequently (according to the same author) she ought to enjoy
the <i>exclusive “customary privilege”</i> of inflicting the horrors of
starvation on the sons of the muses: but it must be granted, for the
honor of British munificence, that the scientific Herschel, in the
decline of life, as a reward for immortalizing his present majesty, by
inscribing Georgium Sidus in the great folio of the heavens, is allowed
the enormous pension of 80<i>l.</i> per annum!!</p>

<p>This instance of <i>liberality</i>, in rewarding merit, has caused me to
suspend <i>my</i> animadversions relative to patronage afforded men of
<i>real science</i> in Great Britain, till I can discover whether it be the
absolute determination of my countrymen to starve doctor Caustic.</p></div>

<p>It is a long time since the public have had any <i>reports</i> from the

made so much <i>noise</i>, that the world had reason to expect that the

cockney sportsman of shooting a tame goose on the first of September.</p>

<p>Whether this mighty affair is all <i>blown up</i>, or what may have been the

that I will apply my own superior talents to this <i>sonorous</i> subject.
Should that happen, those laurels which were designed to decorate
the brow of Mr Howard will be tied in a bow-knot round my venerable

opinion, nothing can be better imagined, or more happily accomplished.
Poetry and oratory, as the ancients inform us, were both <i>whelped</i>

harangue of <i>my</i> bull-baiting friend, William Windham, a British
senator, cannot fail to cut a dash in the stanza of <i>his</i> seraphical

<p>Now, as I am a great admirer of French principles, and that new and
accommodating kind of morality, by Frenchmen discovered, and which I
ever have and ever will eulogize, to the utmost extent of my faculties,
perhaps your worships will express no small degree of wonderment why
I should be the intimate friend of a gentleman, the <i>blaze</i> of whose
oratory, one would suppose, would have <i>blasted</i> Buonaparte, and even
<i>singed</i> the whole French republic. But those who are admitted behind
the political curtain will perceive that the <i>tendency</i> of the measures
which Mr Windham supports is to <i>promote</i> those jacobinic principles,
of which Dr Caustic <i>openly</i> and <i>honestly</i> professes himself to be the
determined propagator and defender.</p></div>

<p>True it is, though “passing strange,” that a <i>great</i> and good
man, composed, as he <i>himself</i> can attest, of the very essence of
humanity, is often most vilely, most audaciously, and most atrociously
bespattered by a set of saucy reviewers.</p>

<p>Those wicked wits, the writers in the <i>Monthly</i> and <i>Critical Reviews</i>,
especially the latter, in a critique on one of the late works of a
certain doctor of self puffing memory, tells us that “the importance of
a man to himself was never more conspicuous than in this publication.
Dr Lettsom admits that he has been anticipated by several distinguished
authors; but modestly hints that some of his particular friends will
form no opinion [respecting the cow-pox] till they have ascertained
<i>his</i> sentiments.” They then have the audacity to declare, that “he
merits no slight punishment for his pompous inflated language, for his
fulsome flattery, and ridiculous exaggeration of every part of the
subject.”</p>

<p>See how they speak of a late publication of the doctor on certain
charitable institutions:&mdash;“Unless to connect these different
institutions, to lead the different radii to a centre, while that
centre is the author and the editor, who can boast, <i>Quæ ipse misserima
vidi, et quorum pars magna fui!</i> we see little advantage in this
edition. We mean not to intimate the slightest disapprobation of these
institutions, or of humanity in general; but when we see pomp and
egotism assuming its garb, when vanity and ostentation occasionally
peep from beneath the robe, we feel no little disgust from comparing
the fascinating exterior with the unpleasing contents,” &amp;c. They
likewise have the impudence to assert that some of the doctor’s plans
are “better suited to the superstition of a Hindoo, than to the nature
of a rational christian.” And in another review they declare: “We mean
not to stoop to any; but will tell Dr Lettsom his faults” [consummate
assurance!!] “as well as any other author; nor will we conceal that
mean mark of a little mind, over-weening vanity. We saw it in its germ,
have watched its opening bud, till it is expanded into its blossom. The
literary life of Dr L&mdash;&mdash; may well be styled the <i>progress</i> of vanity:
the termination is yet to come: but we have ample materials for the
subject.” See <i>Monthly Review</i>, of July, and <i>Critical Review</i>, of
Sept. 1802, and Feb. 1803.</p></div>

<p class="p-left1">They’ll fall before great doctor Lettsom.</p>

<p>I resolved to recommend your arranging yourselves under the banners
of this Leviathan of the Galenical throng, from the moment I first
heard of his noble and spirited sally against the tractors. Disdaining
the wretched trammels of <i>why</i> and <i>wherefore</i>, and without assigning
those paltry trifles, called <i>reasons</i>, for his opinions, on the
merits of Perkinism, our intrepid commander determined to extirpate it
root and branch, with his simple <i>ipse dixit</i>. This is what we ought
to expect from a hero of such prowess. See how well he manages these
metallic makers of mischief! In a eulogium (a very agreeable thing
to a <i>modest</i> man during his life time) on his friend Dr Haygarth,
contained in the work which those wicked reviewers above mentioned have
treated so irreverently, he mentions (page 277) the “important object,”
which Dr Haygarth has so “happily <i>effected</i>.” This is “arresting and
<i>subduing</i> two poisons, the most fatal to the human race (fever and
small-pox) and unveiling imposture, clothed in the meretricious garb
of bold quackery:” a note on the word “<i>imposture</i>,” in the margin
says, “Experiments on metallic tractors.” Now, unless I can borrow
the pen of the learned doctor, dipped in “<span class="smaller">ETHEREAL</span> <i>and
indelible ink</i>,” and a whole literary apparatus in proportion, I shall
never be able to express how much I admire the matter above quoted,
on account of the important <i>intelligence</i> therein contained. Before
Dr L. asserted it, I dare say not an individual in the kingdom knew
that Dr Haygarth had “<i>effected</i>” such an “important object,” that
fever and small-pox were subdued, altogether extinct, despoiled of
that venom which has hitherto “brought death into the world,” and so
much wo. But true it is, they are quite extirpated, and all this by Dr
Haygarth!! One cannot but exclaim against the perverseness of those
members of parliament, who, regardless of this <i>news</i> from Dr L. voted
a reward to Dr Jenner for his services in <i>subduing</i> the small-pox, and
to Dr Smith, for his discoveries in <i>subduing</i> contagious fevers. In
short, I am almost ready to enforce the charge of ignorance against my
brethren in the profession; for I have not yet met with one possessed
of sufficient penetration to see, that neither fever nor small-pox “has
a local habitation and a name among us,” and that they have been both
“<i>subdued</i>,” and all this “<i>effected</i>,” by Dr Haygarth!</p></div>

with becoming vigilance, guarded its post against Perkinean invaders,

<p>I can never sufficiently express my approbation of the Carthagenian
cunning with which this journal has been conducted. Dr B. professing
great impartiality, in an early number, (see vol. ii. p. 85) invited
communications on the subject of the tractors. Subsequent management
evidently showed a slight omission in the doctor’s notice, and that
he meant <i>communications on one side only</i>; for he has omitted no
pains to procure and publish whatsoever could be suggested <i>against</i>
the tractors; but though reports of cases in their favor, and all the
publications of the patentee have been before him, not a syllable
of <i>these</i> was ever noticed by that gentleman; neither has it ever
appeared by his journal that such facts ever existed.</p></div>

<p class="p-left1">By every nostrum, save <i>thine own</i>.</p>

<p>I appeal to any of my brethren who have been gratified, as I often have
been, with the Demosthenes-like torrent which has been so frequently
poured forth, in our medical societies, by this “child and champion”
of the Galenical throng, against quackery and all its appurtenances,
whether it were fair to surmise, as some unconscionable rogues have
done, that Dr B. has absolutely himself become the proprietor of a
quack medicine. The fire of eloquence with which Perkinism, that most
atrocious kind of quackery, has been so frequently, and so effectually
assailed by the learned doctor at the medical society, at Guy’s,
the Lyceum Medico Londinensis, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. ought to have ensured Dr
B. so much of the gratitude of the profession, that, although he
should <i>himself</i> choose to become one of the most arrant quacks in
the kingdom, he might depend on your support of his reputation, and
your exertions to uphold him. No subsequent apostacy on his part, I
maintain, will justify a dereliction of him.</p>

<p>Recal to your recollection, gentlemen, the denunciations he has so
often made against every medical practitioner who should presume,
either directly or indirectly, to offer any patronage to remedies which
bore even the most distant resemblance to a nostrum. How often have the
walls of the medical theatres of Saint Thomas’s hospital, and Windmill
street, echoed loud responses to his declamations against the varlets,
who should dare to recommend means, in the profits of the consumption
of which the whole profession could not participate? How often have you
received his invitations to send him your effusions and declamations
against quackery, to receive an efficient publication in his journal?
and what number of that journal has appeared without performing his
promise, by honoring those effusions with a place in its immortal pages?</p>

<p>Lest even these most important considerations should still find you
inexorable, I trust I can show, by examining his conduct in regard to
the quack medicine in question, that, if it be not praise-worthy, it
is, at least, defensible.</p>

<p>The title of the nostrum which has had the assistance of Dr B. in being
introduced to the notice of a grateful public, is “<span class="smaller">A NEW MEDICINE
FOR THE GOUT</span>.” The pretended discoverer of this specific is, for
very commendable, or, which is the same thing, very <i>prudent</i> reasons,
kept behind the curtain. I wish, however, to express my utter disbelief
that either Dr Brodum or Dr Solomon is the happy mortal, however
similar the style of the pamphlet, announcing this new medicine, may be
to their erudite writings, and the pretensions of the said medicine to
“balms of Gilead” and to “nervous cordials.”</p></div>

<p class="p-left1"><i>All</i> in a chariot take an airing.</p>

<p>I hereby enter a protest against any one of my commentators, whether
he be Vanscanderdigindich the elder, or Hansvanshognosuch, his cousin
<i>German</i> (two <i>Dutch</i> geniuses, who have promised to furnish the next
edition of this my pithy poem with a whole ass-load of annotations)
or any other gentlemen critics or reviewers of equal profoundity,
presuming to intimate, that I intend, by this passage, the smallest
disrespect to your <i>pedestrian</i> physicians. Far from that; I know that
many good and great men (like myself for example) cannot even pay
a shilling for hackney-coach hire. No, gentlemen; I have two great
objects in view, to wit:</p>

<p>1. To encourage my brother B&mdash;to persevere in his laudable attempt to
kick Perkinism back to the country whence it originated, by reminding
him, that if the feat were once performed, he might, <i>perhaps</i>, soon
afford the expense of a chariot to transport, in a respectable manner,
<i>all</i> that wig, without laying the entire burden on the curious sconce
it now envelopes.</p>

<p>2. To remind brother B&mdash;, and the profession in general, how much more
execution may be done by a charioteer than by a pedestrian physician.</p>

<p>Although great men frequently differ, I am happy to find Mr <i>Addison’s</i>
opinion and <i>mine</i>, in this particular, perfectly consentaneous.</p>

<p>“This body of men,” says he, speaking of physicians in our own country,
“may be described like the British army in Cæsar’s time. Some slay in
chariots, and some on foot. If the infantry do less execution than the
charioteers, it is because they cannot be carried, so soon, into all
parts of the town, and despatch so much business in so short a time.”
Spectator, No. 21.</p>

<p>Not an individual, I will venture to assert, who knows my brother B&mdash;,
but must feel the really urgent necessity of elevating him, as soon as
possible, from <i>le pave</i> and giving those talents their full <i>swing</i>.
Then, indeed, soon might our charioteer justly boast&mdash;</p>

<p class="p-left1">From Brodum down to <i>gaseous</i> Thornton.</p>

<p>I am fully sensible that many of my brethren, of less discernment
than myself, would have assigned this famous little genius a rank
on the empirical list even above Dr Brodum. Making <i>puffing</i> their
criterion, they will argue that those acute half-guinea paragraphs
which we occasionally see at the fag end of the <i>Times</i> and other
morning papers, respecting that “very learned physician,”&mdash;his “<i>great</i>
discoveries, and improvements in the medical application of the
gases,”&mdash;his “<i>grand national</i> and botanical work,” and fifty others
of the same strain, asserting the high claims of this <i>airy</i> writer on
the gratitude of the public, are incontestable proofs of his superior
merits in the <i>puffing</i> department, which, say they, are some of the
most necessary ingredients in the formation of a charlatan. All this is
specious reasoning; but I trust I shall show its fallacy. Pre-eminence,
in my opinion, must be founded on some intrinsic excellence, original
and independent of adventitious circumstances. If we closely examine
the merits of this candidate, we shall find that there can be no great
claim on this score. Let any man enjoy the faculties and advantages of
a general dealer in the <i>airs</i>, who must of course have <i>puffs</i> of all
descriptions at hand; and where is the merit of occasionally <i>letting
off one</i>?</p>

<p>If there be anything like originality in this industrious little
philosopher, and for the invention of which I should be inclined to
allow him the credit of ingenuity, it consists in his <i>meritometer</i>,
which proposes to measure the merits of his fellow creatures by the
degree of faith they can afford to bestow on the infallibility of
his gases as a panacea. See his plan of this instrument, or rather
the deductions drawn from his trials of it, in his large five volume
<i>compilation of “Extracts,”</i> vol. i. page 459. From this scale it
appears, that of one thousand of mankind nine hundred and ninety-nine
are either fools or knaves, as that proportion places no confidence
in the efficacy of his catholicon. I hope, therefore, after the good
reasons here assigned for my conduct, I shall not be suspected of
partiality to Dr Brodum in retaining him at the head of the quacks, nor
ill will to Dr T. for not calling him up higher on the list.</p></div>

<p>Now, if in this age of turmoils your worships should have occasion to
educate a school of assassins, to be employed as Talleyrand employs
his agents, for the purpose of promoting modern philanthropy and
French projects of universal empire, I should advise you to prepare
them intellectual food from such descriptions as we have quoted
above. By accustoming your pupils to meditate on such horrible
descriptions you will soon enable them to inflict without compunction
or remorse, sufferings like those, which they have been in the habit of
contemplating.</p>

<p>We are sorry to see, however, that our friend, Dr Darwin, has been
pleased to express his disapprobation of this species of the <i>terrible</i>
in style, without which your small poets can never become conspicuous.
We shall, however, quote one of his sentiments on the subject merely to
let the world know that we great wits do not always tally upon every
point.</p>

<p>The doctor tells us in his Botanic Garden, p. 115, that there is a
“line of boundary between the tragic and the horrid; which line,
however, will veer a little this way or that, according to the
prevailing manners of the age or country, and the peculiar association
of ideas, or idiosyncrasy of mind, of individuals.”</p>

<p>Now I am apprehensive that doctor Darwin would have adjudged the
greater part of Mr Southey’s sublimity to be of the “<i>horrid</i>” rather
than the <i>tragic</i> or <i>sublime</i> kind. Such an opinion, however, would
not only greatly tarnish the reputation of the critic who should
venture to pronounce it, but would entirely put down many pretty
good poets, who, as the Edinburgh reviewers say, must have a “<i>qu’il
mourut</i>,” and a “let there be light” in every line; and all their
characters must be in agonies and ecstacies, from their entrance to
their exit.<a name="FNanchor_G_142" id="FNanchor_G_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_G_142" class="fnanchor">[G]</a></p>

<p>Thalaba, having leaped into a “little car” which appears to have been
drawn by “four living pinions, headless, bodyless, sprung from one

    </div>
  </div>

<p>There’s the <i>bathos</i> to perfection! Now, if we could in any way have
prevailed on Mr Southey to have stopped this side of the centre of
gravity, we should have been happy to have hired his “car” for this
our dreadful rencontre. But as it appears that the Domdaniel cave soon
after <i>fell in</i>, I fancy it would cost more to dig out this vehicle

<p class="p-left1">Huge, hissing hot, and hard as granite.</p>

<p>It is to me a matter of doubt whether your worships are not absolutely
ignorant of the causes and effects of the wonderful phenomena to which
we now allude. But if you will please to take with us a stand for
observation, exactly at the centre of gravity between the earth and the
moon, and look about you with the eyes of great philosophers you will
perceive what is well worth a world of admiration.</p>

<p>You will perceive that what is vulgarly called the <i>man in the moon</i> is
a prodigious volcano, in size much superior to any on our globe, and
that this volcano is continually emitting rocks, which ever and anon
are thrown beyond the sphere of the moon’s attraction, and of course
make their way down upon us.</p>

<p>You will likewise find, by turning to the second volume of the
Philadelphia Literary Magazine, page 389, an account of above thirty
different showers of stones, some of which have weighed not less
than 300 pounds. And you will ascertain that there has been a great
diversity of opinions among philosophers respecting the origin of
these prodigies. Some have believed them to be thrown from some
neighboring volcano. Some have thought them to have been wafted about
by hurricanes. Others have supposed them to have been concretions
formed in the atmosphere. Some have thought them to be masses which
were detached from the planets at the time of the formation; and that
they have been floating about in infinite space till they met with our
earth, which became to them a new centre of gravity.</p>

<p>But the truth is, as you may see through any common optical tube, from
the situation to which I have just had the honor to conduct you, that
these masses of matter are the product of <i>lunar volcanos</i>. Here we
have a cause adequate to the effect, as I shall make evident in the
following few words.</p>

<p>A lunar volcano similar to those on our planet would project bodies
much further from the moon than they would be thrown by the same force
from Etna or Vesuvius; for,</p>

<p>1. It is granted by great philosophers, such as <i>ourself</i> and Dr
Darwin, that the moon has no atmosphere; of consequence, a body
exploded from the moon would meet with no resistance excepting from
the power of gravitation. Dr Darwin informs us, Botanic Garden, canto
ii. “If the moon had no atmosphere at the time of its elevation from
the earth; or if its atmosphere was afterwards stolen from it by the
earth’s attraction, the water on the moon would rise quickly into
vapor; and the cold produced by a certain quantity of this evaporation
would congeal the remainder of it. Hence it is not probable that the
moon is at present inhabited; <i>but as it seems to have suffered and to
continue to suffer much by volcanos</i>, a sufficient quantity of air may
in process of time be generated to produce an atmosphere, which may
prevent its heat from so easily escaping, and its water from so easily
evaporating, and thence become fit for the production of vegetables and
animals.</p>

<p>“That the moon possesses little or no atmosphere is deduced from the
undiminished lustre of the stars at the instant when they emerge from
behind her disk. That the ocean of the moon is frozen is confirmed from
there being no appearance of lunar tides,” &amp;c.</p>

<p>2. Bodies on the moon possess much less gravity in proportion to their
quantity of matter than bodies on the surface of the earth; for matter
is attracted by the earth and moon, respectively, in proportion to the
quantity of matter which each contains. It follows that a comparatively
slight impulse, communicated to a body on the moon’s surface, would be
sufficient to counteract its attraction towards the moon, and if it
were propelled towards the earth it might come within its attraction,
and would of course make its way to our planet.</p>

<p>Thus it appears very evident, even to persons of your worships’
ordinary penetration, that these wonderful showers of stones are of
lunar origin.</p></div>

<p>I feel a very great solicitude to mould and modify every part and

best master-builders of epic poems, tragedies, and other great things
of that kind. The judicious critic will perceive that all my wounds are
inflicted with anatomical accuracy, and I have no doubt but my friend
Dr Haygarth will do himself the honor to write a treatise upon this
subject, and tell the world with what terrible propriety we have hewed
and hacked our opponents in the field of battle. The reverend William
Tasker, A. B. has furnished a model of this species of criticism in <i>A
Series of Letters</i>, respecting “The Anatomical Knowledge of Homer,” &amp;c.
Dr Haygarth I expect will prove that the “death wounds” of Sarpedon,
Hector, Ulysses’ dog, &amp;c. as displayed in the treatise of Dr Tasker,
were mere flea bites compared with these of Dr Caustic.</p></div>

<p class="p-left1">From where the head to where the tail is.</p>

<p>Or more correctly where the tail <i>was</i>. Lord Monboddo tells us
that men, as well as monkies, were formerly dignified with long
tails protruding from the place where (according to Butler) honor
is lodged. Philosophers and antiquaries had never been able to
discover how man became divested of this ornament, till my friend,
Dr Anderson, furnished a clue to the mystery. From this discovery I
am led to suppose that your antediluvian bucks began the practice of
<span class="smaller">CUR</span>-<i>tail</i>-ing these excrescences for gentility’s sake, and
what was at first <i>artificial</i> became in due time <i>natural</i>, till,
at length, your right <i>tippies</i>, as in modern times, were entirely
disencumbered of that monkey-like appendage; but our Bond-street
loungers, although divested of that exterior mark of the monkey, with
a laudable desire to prevent the intentions of Nature from being
defeated, have adopted all the ourang-outang-ical <i>airs</i> which she
originally designed should discriminate that species of <i>animals</i> from
man.</p></div>

<p class="p-left1">With burning lapis infernalis.</p>

<p>The use of this <i>caustic</i> and other escharotics on this momentous
occasion reminds me of an important era in my life, a <i>succinct</i>
biographical sketch of which I shall <i>shortly</i> publish, in nineteen
volumes folio; a work which, in point of size, erudition, and
interesting anecdote, will be immensely preferable to the voluminous
production of lord Orford.</p>

<p>The event in question was of the greater consequence, as it gave rise
to the present family name of “<span class="smcap">Caustic</span>.”</p>

<p>Just thirty-two years since, from the fourteenth day of last July,
while I was prosecuting some of my chymical researches, my eldest
son Tom, a burly-faced boy, since killed in a duel with a hot-headed
Irish gentleman, overturned a bench on which were placed seven carboys
full of acids, alkalies, &amp;c. and broke them into inch pieces. The
consequences of this accident may be more easily conceived than
described. The whole neighborhood was alarmed, and many most terribly
<i>causticized</i> in endeavoring to extinguish the conflagration which
ensued. In the consternation, and amid the exertions to subdue it, some
one cried out that Dr Crichton (for such was my former name, being the
lineal descendant from the celebrated “admirable Crichton”) is fairly a
Dr <span class="smcap">Caustic</span>.</p>

<p>Thus began my <i>honorary</i> name, of which, as it is <i>scientific</i>, I
am not a little proud, especially as it was acquired by virtue of
an <i>explosion</i>, similar to that which gave the honorary appellation
of <i>Bronte</i> to my friend, viscount Nelson of the Nile. For further
particulars respecting this important event, you will please to inquire
at the Herald’s college, where, I dare say, “garter principal king
at arms,” sir Isaac Heard, knt. has done me the justice to register
the occurrence. Instead of lions, bulls, boars, camels, elephants,
and such insignificant <i>animalculæ</i>, my shield is decorated with
insignia more appropriate to my great pretensions. On the left are seen
broken carboys <i>couchant</i>, implying that the secrets of science lie
prostrate before me. On the right are fumes <i>rampant</i>, indicative of my
discoveries, which <i>soar</i> above those of all other pretenders. In the
centre are nine hedgehogs, with quills, <i>stickant</i>, a happy emblem of
my peaceable disposition.</p>

<p>My motto, which I trust sir Isaac has also registered, is worthy of
notice. Dr Darwin was much pleased with it, and, desirous to emulate my
fame in the art of motto making, <i>made</i> “<span class="smaller">OMNIA E CONCHIS</span>.” But
your worships will perceive that the doctor’s motto bears no comparison
with mine, in point of erudition; as I prove myself versed in three
languages; whereas he can boast of only one. Here it comes.</p>

  <div class="poetry-container">
    <div class="poetry">
      <div class="stanza3">
        <div>Ο ανθρωπος, or η γυνη</div>
        <div>Lacessit never me impune!!</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

<p>This, my beautiful and appropriate motto, for the sake of accommodating
those among your worships, who are not versed in the lore of Greece and
Rome, and cannot afford to subsidize men of erudition to officiate for
you in that department of science, I shall render into our vernacular
idiom, as follows:</p>

  <div class="poetry-container">
    <div class="poetry">
      <div class="stanza3">
        <div>If I’m attack’d by man or trollop</div>
        <div>I’ll dose the knave with drastic jalap.</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

<p>Lest the more critical and polite reader should complain, that in order
to <i>let myself down</i> to the level of your worshipful capacities, I
have anglicized my sublime motto in too vulgar and colloquial a style,
I shall take the liberty, politely, to parodize thereon, and, as lord
Bacon says, “to bring it home to men’s business and bosoms;” that is,
to make the application to that particular kind of gentry, against whom
my hedgehog quills, aforesaid, are pointed <i>in terrorem</i>.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
